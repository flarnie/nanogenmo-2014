passes.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He answered, he stood in need of nothing to justify him in what was lawful, but the case of seamen must be very hard, if they must be brought

face to Heaven and the beating rain, calm, resigned, but unshaken; and finding the halter too high for his neck, he boldly stepped upon his coffin, and placed his head in the noose, then watching the first turn of the wheels, he murmured adios todos,  and leaned forward to facilitate his fall.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He made an unreserved confession of his guilt, and became truly penitent; gave up to the keeper the blade of a razor which he had secreted between the soles of his shoes for the acknowledged purpose of adding suicide to his crimes, and seemed to wish for the

situation, which, however, did not sit easy upon him.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He spoke of his long confinement, till I thought the tears were about to start from his eyes, and alluded to his approaching trial with satisfaction; but his predominant characteristic, ferocity, appeared in his small piercing black eyes before I left him, as he alluded to his keeper, the Provost, in such a way that made me suspect his desire for blood was not yet extinguished.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He luffed his ship as close to the wind as possible, in order to clear a point that stretched outward, and beat off to windward, but his leeway carried him towards the land, and he was caught when he least expected the

to his country the truth of Heavens retribution, and heal the wounded feelings of broken kindred with the recital of it.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He quailed in the presence of the dreadful paraphernalia of his punishment, as much as if he had been a stranger to deeds of blood, and never dealt death to his fellow man as he ploughed the deep, under the black flag of piracy, with the motto of Rob, Kill, and Burn.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He arose, raised his hand, and regarded the jury with a firm countenance and steady eye.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He gave the mate about $3000, and the other officers $1000, each; and the crew from $300 to $500, each.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He was familiar with all the outoftheway places of the Havana, and entered into any of the dark abodes without

served three years as a second man.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He had now, perhaps, finished the fight very desperately, if death, who took a swift passage in a grape shot, had not interposed, and struck him directly on the throat.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He is said to have given his orders with boldness and spirit.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He only reserved one ship to send the men on shore, and burnt the remainder, to the number of twenty.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He then pointed to a vessel of forty guns, and a hundred and fifty men; and though her strength was greatly superior to Roberts, yet he made towards her, taking the master of the captured vessel along with him.","nextSentStartsWith":"unshared"},{"sentence":"He at last, in a surly tone, said, he did not regard whom they chose as a commander, provided he was not a papist, for he had conceived a mortal hatred to papists, because his father had been a sufferer in Monmouths
