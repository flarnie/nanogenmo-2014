to my heart.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The jibs behind me  cracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave a sickening  heave and shudder, and at the same moment the

had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt  of swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I  came to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little

sprinkled the floor with a continual rain  of fine sand.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The latter  stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the  surface of the sand.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the  woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was  far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat  of the day, chilled me through my jacket.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The next moment each of us had taken to his heels  in a different direction.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry:         Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey,

source of danger was the gun.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The gig was no longer to be feared; the little point had already  concealed it from our eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a  great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction  I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling  into their places in the boats.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The gun!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The tide keeps washing her down.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The rest of the arms and powder we dropped  overboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see  the bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy  bottom.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The squire was sitting down, as  white as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The gigs had leaned to their right, but Hunter and I pulled straight in,  in the direction of the stockade upon the chart.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The pitch was  bubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick;  if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was in that abominable  anchorage.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The captain, the squire, and I  were talking matters over in the cabin.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about  the cutwater.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The marsh was  steaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the Spyglass trembled  through the haze.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The isle was  uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front  of me but dumb brutes and fowls.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start  and being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of  her consort, and the bow had struck among the shoreside trees and I  had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest  thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The  honest handsand I was soon to see it proved that there were such on  boardmust have been very stupid fellows.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The place was entirely landlocked, buried in woods, the trees coming  right down to highwater mark, the shores mostly flat, and the hilltops  standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one  there.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The bottom was clean sand.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The heat was sweltering,  and the men grumbled fiercely over their work.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The men are  not shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The stern  window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon  shining behind on the ships wake.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master  of himself.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of  points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the  island on the east.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The last moment I can manage, and thats when.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The watch was all forward looking out for the island.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with  a whiff of spray.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The captain, on his part, never spoke  but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a  word wasted.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest  man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as  mate.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable  seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The old one, cried another.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The new arrangement was quite to my liking.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The captain has said too much or he has said too  little, and Im bound to say that I require an explanation of his words.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and  shut the door behind him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away, but we all  agreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented,  Long John took up his crutch and

north cache; you can find       it by the trend of the east hummock, ten fathoms       south of the black crag with the face on it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out  the map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of  hills and bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed  to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The sums are the scoundrels  share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something  clearer.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate  entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total  had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words  appended, Bones, his pile.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of  entries.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened  it, for Dr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open  it; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his  coat.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The  house was all dark to the front.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The blind man cursed the money.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The next moment his voice  showed me that I was right.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The fog was rapidly  dispersing; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on  either side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the

apoplexy.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went out of  him and left him staring sober.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fist  and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The captain is not what he  used to be.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The doctor I began.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The man has had a stroke, as I warned him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The captain, for  his part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The captain made a sort of gasp.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had  gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a  man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything  can be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn  so old and sick.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The  stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the  corner like a cat waiting for a mouse.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all  pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was  mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again,  glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath,  Silence, there, between decks!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The voices  stopped at once, all but Dr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"The man who came  with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at  the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the  coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and

for his bodily weakness, more violent than  ever.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual,  though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of  rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through  his nose, and no one dared to cross him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay adying, like as if I  was to now, you see.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was growing more and

bribe.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little  higher, and he seemed both weak and excited.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was breathing  very loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible  colour.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"he asked with a kind of leer.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He spoke to him as before, over his  shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the  room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: If you do not put that  knife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall  hang at the next assizes.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He sprang to his feet, drew and opened  a sailors claspknife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand,  threatened to pin the doctor to the wall.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor  father was far gone in a decline that took him off.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He never wrote or received a letter,  and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the  most part, only when drunk on rum.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was a very silent man by custom.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then snatched one of the flags, and retired to the interior of the tower; in a few minutes he reappeared, took a second and descended.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He arrived off Algiers on the morning of the 27th of August, and sent in his interpreter, Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He gave me reproachful words; and it is well that we did not come to blows, but I went my way, and he, seeing me resolute, followed.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He says I now first opened my design to my comrades, informing them, that I had contrived the model of a boat, which, being formed in pieces, and afterwards put together, might be the means of our deliverance.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He traded in tobacco and a few trifling articles, so that a strict watch was not kept on his movements.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was now compelled to go, loaded with heavy stones, through the whole of the town; and at almost every step he received dreadful blows, not being able to hasten his pace from the great weight.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was, however, sent for, and the menial offices they were both engaged to perform were only nominal.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was both surprised and pleased, supposing that he would have a mistress to himself; but he was greatly mistaken, and he found that it was necessary to court her for his wife.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He wept bitterly.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He chose those prayers he thought most adapted to the occasion.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then joined in prayer with the others.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was innocentthey had both been

Mexican, was afterwards chased by an English government vessel, from Jamaica, which was cruising in search of it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He remained with us, until his death, which took place in 1829.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He spoke several living languages, and was skilled in drawing and painting.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was the youngest of thirteen children, and being, as he said, of a roving disposition, had always followed the seas.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He told me that before he came to Massachusetts, he saw the villainous pilot of the Mexican, the infamous Baltizar, with several other pirates, brought into Montego Bay, from whence they were to be conveyed to Kingston to be executed.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He arrived in safety at Kingston, and from there, travelled barefoot over the mountains, until very much exhausted, he reached Montego Bay, where he had friends, and where one of his brothers possessed some property.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He told me that after we separated in Trinidad, he remained on board the Spanish brig.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He likewise took Manuel and my three men for that night.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then related to me the manner of their desertion from the pirates; as nearly as I can recollect his own words, he said, A few days since, the pirates took four small vessels, I believe Spaniards; they having but two officers for the two first, the third fell to me as prize master, and having an understanding with the three Frenchmen and Thomas, selected them for my crew, and went on board with orders to follow the Mexican; which I obeyed.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then said, I have a mother in Saco where I belongshe is a second time a widowtomorrow if you can spare a scrap of paper and pencil I will write something.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"he answered, no, only two dayswe go for water and wood, then come back, take you.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He kept at a good distance from me, and forbid my friend Nickolas speaking to me.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He further told me, after tomorrow you shall go with your vessel, and we will accompany you towards Trinidad.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He stated, that he was at New Orleans last summer, out of employment, and became acquainted with one Captain August Orgamar, a Frenchman, who had bought a small schooner of about fifteen tons, and was going down to the bay of Mexico to get a commission under General Traspelascus, in order to go a privateering under the patriot flag.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He lamented most deeply his own situation, for he was one of those men, whose early good impressions were not entirely effaced, although confederated with guilt.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He displayed, living and dying, a magnanimity that sheds lustre on his relatives, his friends, and his country.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He fell, pierced by two musket balls, in the van of a division of boats, attacking their principal vessel, a fine schooner of about eighty tons, with a long eighteen pounder on a pivot, and four smaller guns, with the bloody flag nailed to the mast.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He hastened to their assistance.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He derived this name from his long black beard, which, like a frightful meteor, covered his whole face, and terrified all America more than any comet that had ever appeared.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He at the same time desired them to take their pistols, cutlasses, and swords, and be ready for action upon his call, and, for greater expedition, two ladders were placed in the hatchway.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He brought the freighted vessel into North Carolina, where the governor and Black Beard shared the prizes.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was buried with the same ceremony they used at the funerals of their companions, which is mentioned in the account of Halsey.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He had been a forced man, and a ship carpenter.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He asked, upon what account?","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was carried by Collins on board Booths ship, where, at first, he was talked to in pretty strong terms; but after a while very civilly used, and the next morning sent up to the king with a guide, and peace made for him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He told the purser he was his prisoner, and must answer the damage done to two merchants who were slaving.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He would have been glad of taking some of the wrecked Frenchmen, but for the barbarity they had used towards the English prisoners.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He had the command of the Marygold brigantine given him, in which he made two successful voyages to Guinea and back to Barbadoes.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was the mildest mannerd man,   That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat;   With such true breeding of a gentleman,   You never could discern his real thought.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He immediately got under sail, and missed the pirate but four hours.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was sent on board without hesitation.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He lay off and on the harbor, swearing he would have his quarter master, and intercepted two fishing shallops, on board of one of which was the captain of the galleys brother.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He chained him to a sheet anchor which was ashore, and planted guns at the point, to prevent the pirate getting out, but to little purpose; for the people at one of these points firing too soon, Lewis quitted the ship, and, by the help of oars and the favor of the night, got out in his sloop, though she received many shot in her hull.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He took out of his prizes what he had occasion for, forty able negro sailors, and a white carpenter.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He ordered them a berth on deck, at the after part of the vessel, where they had nothing to shelter them from the weather, which at this time was very variablethe days excessively hot, and the nights cold, with heavy rains.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He said the English ships would join the Mandarins and attack them.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He took me by the coat, and drew me close to him; then questioned the interpreter very strictly, asking who we were, and what was our business in that part of the country.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was seated on deck, in a large chair, dressed in purple silk, with a black turban on.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He left the ship in one of the cutters, with seven British seamen well armed, on the 17th September, 1809.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He had seen the unfriendly intention of the mandarin, and thrown himself down.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was a tool in the hands of the government of Cochin; and, as the dog said in the fable, What is done by the masters orders, is the masters action; or, as the same sentiment is, perhaps, better expressed in the legal axiom; Qui facit per alium facit per se.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was about to have excused himself, but they threatened to shoot him; and when he expostulated, and claimed their promise to put him on shore, he received an unmerciful beating from the quartermaster; Captain Taylor, to whom that duty belonged, being lame in his hands.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He likewise acquainted him, that his influence and authority among them was giving place to that of Captain Taylor, chiefly because the dispositions of the latter were more savage and brutal.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He now went into the harbor, cleaned his own ship, and fitted up the Peterborough, which he called the Victory.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He accordingly discovered that, during the chase, the captain had hung a bag with eleven thousand moidores out of the cabin window, and that, when they were taken, he had cut the rope, and allowed it to fall into the sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then came home to see his mother in England, returned to Boston, and continued for some years longer at the same business.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He went to sea in company with his brother, and continued with him for three or four years.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was by nature a pirate; for even when very young he raised contributions among the boys of Westminster, and if they declined compliance, a battle was the result.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He continued his course for the EastIndies, where he made a very great booty; and returning, touched at the island of Mascarenhas, where he met with a Portuguese ship of 70 guns, with the viceroy of Goa on board.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He from this went to the Guinea coast, and took Capt.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He sent some of his men ashore to kill some wild cattle, but they were taken by the crew of a Spanish manofwar.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He took what provision and other necessaries he wanted, and having augmented his company by volunteers and forced men, he left the ships and sailed to St.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He asked me to produce what money I had about me; on seeing only ten rupees, he remarked that it was not worth while to win so small a sum, but that if I would fight cocks with him he would lend me as much money as I wanted, and added it was beneath his dignity to fight under fifty reals a battle.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was the more confident of success, as the European vessel was observed to keep away out of the proper course on approaching her.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He is dreaded by people of all denominations, and universally known as the prince of pirates.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He formed a scheme to accomplish his purpose, and communicated the same to his men.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was not a little surprised that she did not endeavor to make off, and began to suspect her strength.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then fired his pistol out of the window.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He whispered his intelligence to his master, who being surrounded by his own friends, and seeing the governor unattended by any of his retinue, presented a pistol to the breast of the latter, informing him that he was a dead man, unless he should surrender the fort and all its riches.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He discovered that there was a sentry standing near a guardhouse, in which there were a quantity of arms heaped up in a corner, and that a considerable number of small arms were in the governors hall.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then ran under the fort and cast anchor, and having ordered out the boat, manned with six men indifferently dressed, he, with the master and doctor, dressed themselves like gentlemen, in order that the one party might look like foremastmen, and the other like merchants.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He likewise made free with one of the ships, equipped her for his own purpose, and called her the King James.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He next directed his course towards the western islands, and from Cape de Verd islands cast anchor at St.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then despatched four of his men to the other ship, and calling aloud to them, desired that his compliments should be given to the captain, with a request to send a sufficient number of hands to go on board their new prize, to see what they had got in her.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then commenced chase, and ordered his prize to do the same.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then drew up a code of laws, to which he himself swore, and required the same bond of alliance from all the rest of the crew.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He added, that England, pleased with his conduct, had made him captain in room of Skinner, giving him a sealed paper, which he was not to open until he was in a certain latitude, and then expressly to follow the given directions.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was now arrested by some patriotic individuals.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He finally left the unhappy province of Conception, the theatre of so many miserable scenes, overwhelmed with the misery which he had caused, without ever recollecting that it was in that province that he had first drawn his breath.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He received them very gruffly, and appeared irritated and sulky at having been disturbed; he was still more offended when he learned that they wished to see his captive.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was a tall, broad shouldered man; with a prodigiously large head, and a squareshaped bloated face, from which peeped out two very small eyes, partly hid by an immense superfluity of black, coarse, oily, straight hair, covering his cheeks, hanging over his shoulders, and rendering his head somewhat the shape and size of a beehive.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He of course, was always looking out for some plan of escape, and at length an opportunity occurring, he, with the mate of the Ocean, and nine of his crew, seized two whale boats, imprudently left on the banks of the river, and rowed off.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He treated the officers, too, not unkindly, allowed them to live in his house, and was very anxious on all occasions, to have their advice respecting the equipment of his troops.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He equipped a corsair, with instructions to capture the vessels of all nations; and as Araucan is directly opposite the island of Santa Maria, where vessels put in for refreshment, after having doubled Cape Horn, his situation was well adapted for his purpose.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was a man of ferocious manners, and had been guilty of several murders.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was tied up a second time, and more effectually.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He said, he went out in a laudable employment and had no occasion, being then in good circumstances, to go a pirating; that the men often mutinied against him, and did as they pleased; that he was threatened to be shot in the cabin, and that ninetyfive left him at one time, and set fire to his boat, so that he was disabled from bringing his ship home, or the prizes he took, to have them regularly condemned, which he said were taken by virtue of a commission under the broad seal, they having French passes.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He answered, he stood in need of nothing to justify him in what was lawful, but the case of seamen must be very hard, if they must be brought into such danger for obeying the commands of their officers, and punished for not obeying them; and if they were allowed to dispute the orders, there could be no such thing as command kept up at sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He even attempted to defend himself when arrested, but was secured and thrown into prison.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He also used the men very cruelly, causing them to be hoisted up by the arms, and drubbed with a naked cutlass, to force them to discover whether they had money on board, and where it lay; but as they had neither gold nor silver on board, he got nothing by his cruelty; however, he took from them a bale of pepper, and a bale of coffee, and so let them go.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He knew all their haunts and lurking places, and was always hooking about on mysterious voyages.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was somewhat of a trader, something more of a smuggler, but mostly a pirate.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He mounted the cart as firmly as he had walked behind it, and held up his face to Heaven and the beating rain, calm, resigned, but unshaken; and finding the halter too high for his neck, he boldly stepped upon his coffin, and placed his head in the noose, then watching the first turn of the wheels, he murmured adios todos,  and leaned forward to facilitate his fall.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He made an unreserved confession of his guilt, and became truly penitent; gave up to the keeper the blade of a razor which he had secreted between the soles of his shoes for the acknowledged purpose of adding suicide to his crimes, and seemed to wish for the moment that was to send him before his Creator.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He sometimes spoke to the guards around him, and sometimes affected an air of carelessness of his awful situation, which, however, did not sit easy upon him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He spoke of his long confinement, till I thought the tears were about to start from his eyes, and alluded to his approaching trial with satisfaction; but his predominant characteristic, ferocity, appeared in his small piercing black eyes before I left him, as he alluded to his keeper, the Provost, in such a way that made me suspect his desire for blood was not yet extinguished.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He luffed his ship as close to the wind as possible, in order to clear a point that stretched outward, and beat off to windward, but his leeway carried him towards the land, and he was caught when he least expected the trap.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He had a fair wind until he came within sight of the coast near that city.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He might as well have asked him to produce the philosophers stone.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He did not, however, fire immediately, but waited until he was nearly abreast of his victim; then directing the aim himself, and ordering a man to stand by the flag to haul it down, fired with an air that showed he was sure of his mark.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He alone will carry back to his country the truth of Heavens retribution, and heal the wounded feelings of broken kindred with the recital of it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He quailed in the presence of the dreadful paraphernalia of his punishment, as much as if he had been a stranger to deeds of blood, and never dealt death to his fellow man as he ploughed the deep, under the black flag of piracy, with the motto of Rob, Kill, and Burn.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He arose, raised his hand, and regarded the jury with a firm countenance and steady eye.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He gave the mate about $3000, and the other officers $1000, each; and the crew from $300 to $500, each.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He

companion through the doubtful struggle in which the republic was engaged.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He and his comrades even lodged in the very houses with many of the American officers who were sent out to take them.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He resolved to abandon it and again try the sea for a subsistence.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He opened a grocery in Ann Street, near what was then called the Tin Pot, a place full of abandoned women and dissolute fellows.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He went willingly into the pirate service, and served three years as a second man.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He had now, perhaps, finished the fight very desperately, if death, who took a swift passage in a grape shot, had not interposed, and struck him directly on the throat.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He is said to have given his orders with boldness and spirit.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He only reserved one ship to send the men on shore, and burnt the remainder, to the number of twenty.","nextSentStartsWith":"come"},{"sentence":"He then pointed to a vessel of forty guns, and a hundred and fifty men; and though her strength was greatly superior to Roberts, yet he made towards her, taking the master of the captured vessel along with him.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"He at last, in a surly tone, said, he did not regard whom they chose as a commander, provided he was not a papist, for he had conceived a mortal

rendered still more so by several scars there, and by the loss of one eye.","nextSentStartsWith":"my"},{"sentence":"He gradually recovered, however, without surgical aid, and the bone of the arm between the shoulder and elbow being completely shivered to pieces, the fragments progressively worked out, and the singular appearance was left of the fore arm and elbow connected to the shoulder by flesh and skin, and tendons, without the least vestige of bone.","nextSentStartsWith":"some"},{"sentence":"He had been there but a few days, when he fell sick and died; not being worth so much as would buy him a coffin!","nextSentStartsWith":"they"},{"sentence":"He therefore determined to go privately to Bristol, and have an interview with the merchants himself,where, instead of money, he met with a mortifying repulse; for, when he desired them to come to an account with him, they silenced him by threatening to disclose his character; the merchants thus proving themselves as good pirates on land as he was at sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"they"},{"sentence":"He inquired, saying, What is the matter with the ship?","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"He was a fellow of more cunning than courage, and insinuating himself into the confidence of some of the boldest men in the ship, he represented the immense riches which were to be acquired upon the Spanish coast, and proposed to run off with the ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"He was a native of Devonshire (Eng.","nextSentStartsWith":"a"},{"sentence":"He fled for safety to the Scandinavian island of Soderoe,

with some pirates who had been upon the island above twentyfive years.","nextSentStartsWith":"after"},{"sentence":"He was dressed in the usual Arab garments, with a cashmeer shawl, turban, and a scarlet benish, of the Persian form, to distinguish him from his followers.","nextSentStartsWith":"three"},{"sentence":"He carried this simplicity to a degree of filthiness, which was disgusting, as his usual dress was a shirt, which was never taken off to be washed, from the time it was first put on till worn out; no drawers or coverings for the legs of any kind, and a large black goats hair cloak, wrapped over all with a greasy and dirty handkerchief, called the keffeea, thrown loosely over his head.","nextSentStartsWith":"now,"},{"sentence":"He therefore conceived the bold project of proceeding to the Bay of Bengal, in order to get provisions from on board some English ships.","nextSentStartsWith":"dance"},{"sentence":"He thought very prudently that the papers contained in the

consideration.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"He now wrote to Capt.","nextSentStartsWith":"indeed,"},{"sentence":"He does hereby invite them to join the standard of the United States and is

men.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He took no notice of it, and his men almost as little, some saying she was a Portuguese ship, others a French slave ship, but the major part swore it was the French Ranger returning; and they were merrily debating for some time on the manner of reception, whether they should salute her or not; but as the Swallow approached nearer, things appeared plainer; and though they who showed any apprehension of danger were stigmatized with the name of cowards, yet some of them, now undeceived, declared it to Roberts, especially one Armstrong, who had deserted from that ship, and knew her well.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He settled himself on the tackles of a gun; which one Stephenson, from the helm, observing, ran to his assistance, and not perceiving him wounded, swore at him, and bade him stand up and fight like a man; but when he found his mistake, and that his captain was certainly dead, he burst into tears, and wished the next shot might be his portion.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was now made to labor on a farm; but having a great antipathy to work, when about fifteen years of age, feeling a great inclination to roam, and like too many unreflecting youths of that age, a great fondness for the sea, he in opposition to the friendly counsel of his parents, privately left them and entered on board the United States sloopofwar, Hornet, and was in the action when she captured the British sloopofwar Peacock, off the coast of Pernambuco.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was acquainted with many of the officers and was apprised of all their intended movements before they left the harbor.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He passed several weeks in the city of New

Boston.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He thanked me, and said he hoped he should not be deceived; upon which we drank to his health and to the success of the Republic.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He said no, as he did not believe there was money in the vessel.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He said he might be called a pirate, a robber, and a murderer, and he was all of these, but he hoped and trusted God would, through Christ, wash away his aggravated crimes and offences, and not cast him entirely out.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then shook hands with Gibbs, the officers, and clergymentheir caps were drawn over their faces, a handkerchief dropped by Gibbs as a signal to the

Mexican.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He is set down as a free black in the ships papers, but that is no proof that he is free.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He is in all probability a slave, and a native African, as the tattooing on his face proves beyond a doubt.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He is no drift weed on the ocean of life.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He has nerves to feel pain, and a heart to throb with human affections, even as you have.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He is much altered; has become thinner, and his countenance this morning was expressive of the deepest despondency.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He therefore required a considerable number of hands for the enterprise; and in such a traffic, it may be easily conceived, that the morals of the crew could not be a subject of much consideration with the employer.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He arrived in Africa, took in a considerable number of slaves, and in order to complete his cargo, went on shore, leaving his mate in charge of the vessel.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He at once decided on seizing the ship upon the strength of his party: and without consulting the mate, he collected all the arms of the vessel, called the conspirators together, put into each of their possession a cutlass and a brace of pistols, and arming himself in like manner, advanced at the head of the gang, drew his sword, and declared the mate to be the commander of the ship, and the men who joined him part owners.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then ordered the sails to be squared, and ran before the wind in chase

around him, he determined not to strike.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"he was woefully deceived in his estimate of the villains nature, and felt, when too late, that even death would have been preferable to the barbarous treatment he was forced to endure.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He reproached Barbazan, and those who had accompanied them in the boarding, with disobeying his orders, and declared that now there could be no security for their lives.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He therefore resolved to go in alone; and his object in doing so was to procure a supply of money by a letter of credit which he brought with him from Cadiz.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He dressed expensivelygenerally wore a white hat of the best English quality, silk stockings, white trowsers, and blue frock coat.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was deeply browned with the sun, and had an air and gait expressive of his bold, enterprising, and desperate mind.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He appeared to me such a man as would have made a hero in the ranks of his country, had circumstances placed him in the proper road to fame; but ignorance and poverty turned into the most ferocious robber, one who might have rendered service and been an honor to his sunken country.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He had traded many years among the pirates, in a little rakish vessel, that could run into all kinds of water.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He therefore ordered a man continually to watch at the mast head, lest this fleet should go by them; and about four days after, towards evening, it

part of his immense treasure, which has never been found, and then carried a high head about the streets of Boston.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was told by the court, that acting under the commission justified in what was lawful, but not in what was unlawful.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was but too successful.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He converted the whale spears and harpoons into lances for his cavalry, and halberts for his sergeants; and out of the sails he made trowsers for half of his army; the carpenters he set to work making baggage carts and repairing his boats; the armourers he kept perpetually at work, mending muskets, and making pikes; managing in this way, to turn the skill of every one of his prisoners to some useful account.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He was too late, however; the Chilian forces had already made a successful attack, and the Indians had fled, setting fire to the town and the ships.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He then addressed them in a short and appropriate speech, the substance of which was, a proclamation of war with the whole world.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He replied, that he was disposed to give them employment until his companion came up, who was able to contend with them; meanwhile assuring them that, if they did not strike to him, it would most certainly fare the worse for them: then giving them a broadside, he received the same in return.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He remained here five weeks, and he and half of his crew visited the principal town of the island.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He also received a considerable reinforcement of men, the greater part

Portuguese who fell into his hands, who were many, very barbarously, cutting off their ears and noses; and as his master was a papist, when they took a priest, they made him say mass at the mainmast, and would afterwards get on his back and ride him about the decks, or else load and drive him like a beast.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He next sailed into the harbor of Port Rosemary, where were thirteen ships, but none of them of any great strength.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"He next sailed down to Whydah road, where Captain La Bouche had been before England, and

Mandarins; and if these boats should be detected in having any intercourse with the Ladrones, they are immediately put to death, and all their relations, though they had not joined in the crime, share

pirate Vane, and also, that some of her men, while they were prisoners on board of him, had heard the pirates say they should clean in one of the rivers to the southward, he altered his first design, and instead of standing to the northward, in pursuit of the pirate in Cape Fear river, turned to the southward after Vane, who had ordered such reports to be given out, on purpose to put any force

overboard.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"It had not been our way to build great fires; we were, indeed,  by the captains orders, somewhat niggardly of firewood, and I began to  fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"It is not a pleasant noise in  itself, and I have often complained of it at other times, but just  then it was

instantly.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But it was not its size that now impressed my companions; it was the  knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere  buried below its spreading shadow.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But you can never tell what will  affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry was greatly  relieved.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers, rather,  indeed, of growing terror at the irreverence of his

I cannot get a word in.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But the  point is, had he money?","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But he was on his feet again in a  second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the  nearest of the coming horses.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But with all that,  he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather  wandering.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But as things fell out, my poor  father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters  on one

I was in your hands.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But the nature of their works was illcalculated to withstand the scientific accuracy with which the besiegers made their attack.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But a new power was destined to spring up, from which these pirates were to receive their first check; that power was the United States of America.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But we presently returned to our boat, and from being wearied with the exertion, and somewhat cooled by the sea, lay down to sleep with as much security as if it had been in our beds.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But we soon discovered that our calculations of lading were erroneous; for no sooner had we embarked, than the water came in over the sides, and she was like to sink; so that some new device became necessary.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But we had not been long at work, when the smell of the melting materials overcame me, and obligated me to go into the streets gasping for breath, where meeting with the cool air, I swooned away, and broke my face in the fall.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But there remained another difficulty; she had left her son chained in the midst of that dungeon from which she had just been rescued.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But this was not necessary, for the lovers attachment was equal, if not stronger than her own; they pledged their faith, which was esteemed as binding as if the ceremony had been performed by a clergyman.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But there being no prospect of preferment in time of peace, she went on board a vessel bound for the West Indies.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But Mary Reads felicity was of short duration; the husband died, and peace being concluded, her business diminished.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But as she grew up, she informed her of the secret of her birth, in order that she might conceal her sex.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But it seemed impossible to impose upon an old experienced mother.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But alas!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But the surf on the beach was so very rough, that we were again compelled to postpone it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But pity in such monsters was not to be found.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But the captain forbid his giving it to me, and I stepped into the boatat that moment Nickola said in a low voice, never mind, I may see you again before I die.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But not satisfied they proceeded to search the state rooms and forcastle, ripped up the floor of the later and found some boxes of bottled cider, which they carried to their vessel, gave three cheers, in an exulting manner to me, and then began drinking it with such freedom, that a violent quarrel arose between officers and men, which came very near ending in bloodshed.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But I found him, as I suspected, a consummate hypocrite; indeed, his very looks indicated it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But a chief peculiarity of some of the islands, and which renders them suitable to those who frequent them as pirates, are the numerous caves with which the rocks are perforated; some of them are above highwater mark, but the majority with the sea water flowing in and out of them, in some cases merely rushing in at highwater filling deep pools, which are detached from each other when the tide recedes, in others with a sufficient depth of water to allow a large boat to float in.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But there are limits to human insolence and depravity.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But the others did not think it reasonable he should have the boat, but that it should be set to sale for the benefit of the

treachery.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But in brief space of time, the long dreaded widow of Chingyih, supported by her Lieutenant Paou, and followed by three other of her principal commanders, mounted the side of the governors ship, and rushed through the smoke to the spot where his excellency was stationed; where they fell on their hands and knees, shed tears, knocked their heads on the deck before him, and received his gracious pardon, and promised for future kind treatment.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But if he continued to resist, not only a general arming of all the coast and the rivers, but Opotae was to proceed against him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"But the pirates, full of confidence, now resolved to attack the harbors

beaten; in revenge, he got most of the arms forward into the hold, and designed to blow up the sloop; upon which, some advised scuttling the deck, and throwing grenade shells down, but Condent said

to give the alarm.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"They constantly carry about with them a smooth tongue, cringing demeanor, a complying disposition, which always asserts, and never contradicts; a countenance which appears to anticipate the very wish of the Europeans, and which so generally imposes upon his understanding, that he at once concludes them to be the best and gentlest

added to their strength.","nextSentStartsWith":"bass,"},{"sentence":"They obeyed, and being assembled, he suggested to them the necessity of securing the property which they had acquired in some safe place on shore, and observed, that the chief difficulty was to get it safe on shore; adding that, if either of the sloops should be attacked alone, they would not be able to make any great resistance,

labour and danger as might be; and until that was  done I considered that my life would certainly be spared.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes

I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an  adversary.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers,  before me this lurking nondescript.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that for the  next little while the whole world swam away from

in my ear.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be  drawing near along the borders of the fen.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I heard him shouting.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their  shins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out  of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a  faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the  anchorage.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I dont know about treasure, he said, but Ill stake my wig theres  fever here.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had  to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my  eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this  standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never  learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an  empty stomach.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether  helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed  through me that safety came.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge  of the island, and I own I was halffrightened when I saw him drawing  nearer to myself.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have a chart here, says Captain Smollett.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have, sir, said Silver.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could hear people  tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an  instant outside my barrel, I dived behind the foresail, made a double  towards the stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join  Hunter and Dr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and  the voice of Hands exclaimed, Oh, stow that!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I know you.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I want their pickles and wines, and  that.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I never sailed  along of him; first with England, then with Flint, thats my story;  and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I seen him grapple  four

that Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I see things going,  as I think, not quite right.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I see, said the

dont like them, sir, returned Captain Smollett.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I dont call that fair, now, do you?","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I cant speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried, said the  captain.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I dont like this cruise; I dont like the men; and  I dont like my officer.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I am always at the captains orders.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I began to see that here was one of the best of  possible shipmates.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could not help joining, and we laughed together, peal after peal,  until the tavern rang again.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I see that when you first come in.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I dont care two coppers who he is, cried Silver.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up  to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I  set off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and  seamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and  bales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until I found the tavern in  question.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the  ocean.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me,  not at all of the home that I was leaving; and now, at sight of this  clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I  had my first attack of tears.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was half  beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old  Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I       have a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things       shall go manowar fashion on board the good ship

my old       tarpaulins tramping round the capstan.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was standing on the dock, when, by the       merest accident, I fell in talk with him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which  I well remembered.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could not help  wondering who it was that had got itt, and what itt was that he got.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet  where the horses were.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I thought perhaps Dr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a  house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down  by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself;  and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captains  moneybag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we  were ruined.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had thought it to be the blind mans  trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found  that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its  effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I wish I had put his eyes  out!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven  or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along  the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I do not know how I found the strength to do it  at all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her  down the bank and a little way under the arch.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I am  going to faint.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I ran to him at once, calling to my mother.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I held out my hand, and the horrible, softspoken, eyeless creature  gripped it in a moment like a vise.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I hear a voice, said he, a young voice.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I never saw in my life a more dreadfullooking figure.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he  seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it  neither; and Ill trick em again.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I cant do that; theyd have the black  spot on me by then.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I  havent had a drop this blessed day.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have  drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week  where he isthat is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke  would settle him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his  throat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I must get away from here.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I  was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my  fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I told him he was out walking.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I told you.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I took a step nearer.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but  as I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table  and motioned me to draw near.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I  had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I  remember this one puzzled me.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I  remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and  the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort  of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have seen him wringing his hands after such a  rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have  greatly hastened his early and unhappy death.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself  as he did so, and then breaking out in that old seasong that he sang so  often afterwards:              Fifteen men on the dead mans chest               Yohoho, and a bottle of rum!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I love to see flow,   At the stroke of my sabre, the

nobody.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was taken by the pirates and they made me help them; they would not let me be idle.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was in trade, between Boston and Philadelphia, at the time he came to Massachusetts, and he sailed with me several trips as my mate.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I beheld once more the preserver of my life; the instrument, under Providence, of restoring me to my home, my family, and my friends, and I regarded him with no ordinary emotion.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I immediately wrote to him, and invited him to come on to the United States.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I felt great anxiety to learn what became of Jamieson, who, my readers will recollect, was detained on board the Spanish brig Prudentee near Trinidad.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I am fully of the opinion that these ferocious pirates are linked in with many inhabitants of Cuba; and the government in many respects appears covertly to encourage them.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was greatly disappointed in not finding Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was kindly invited by Captain Matthew Rice, of schooner Galaxy, of Boston, to go on board his vessel, and live with him during my stay there.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I pointed them out to him, and he ordered them the liberty of the decks; but my friend Nickola and his three associates were immediately put in irons.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I told him we thought her a pirate, and did not like to be taken by them again, having already suffered too much; showing my papers.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I reluctantly acquiesced, and handed up the gunscommenced firing upon them and they upon us.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I left her with peculiar emotions, such as I hope never again to experience; and returned to the little sloop where we remained till  Friday, 8thWhen I had disposition to visit the island on which we were first imprisoned.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I jumped on her deck, saw a fire in the camboose, but no person there: I called aloud Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I advised him to get on board an American vessel, whenever an opportunity offered, and come to the United States; and on his arrival direct a letter to me; repeating my earnest desire to make some return for the disinterested friendship which he had shown toward me.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I knew it was impossible you could have been liberated, and therefore we determined among ourselves, that should an opportunity occur we would come and save your lives, as we now have.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I asked which way they intended to go?","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I took the last piece of paper I had, and wrote with pencil a few words, informing him (should he come there) that I and the rest were safe; that I was not mistaken in the friend in whom I had placed so much confidence, that he had accomplished my highest expectations; and that I should go immediately to Trinidad, and requested him to go there also, and apply to Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I drank as much as I judged prudent.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I found it necessary for six; four to row, one to steer and one to bale.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I assure you, we were very wretched; and to paint the scene, is not within my power.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I told him that I hoped not, but thought they would give us our small boat and liberate the prisoners.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I now had some hopes of visiting my vessel againbut the pirates made sail, ran down, took us in tow and stood out of the harbor.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I obeyed, and when at some distance from my fellow prisoners, (his men following) he said, the captain send me for your wash I pretended not to understand what he meant, and replied, I have no clothes, nor any soap to wash withyou have taken them all, for I had kept my watch about me, hoping they would not discover it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was immediately ordered into the boat with my crew, not allowed any breakfast, and carried about three miles to a small island out of sight of the Exertion, and left there by the side of a little pond of thick, muddy water, which proved to be very brackish, with nothing to eat but a few biscuits.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was then suffered to go on board my own vessel, and found her in a very filthy condition; sails torn, rigging cut to pieces, and every thing in the cabin in waste and confusion.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I endeavored to get it from him, but did not succeed.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I soon returned to the Mexican and my mate to the Exertion, with George Reed, one of my crew; the other two being kept on board the Mexican.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I requested him to examine the papers thoroughly, and perhaps he would be convinced to the contrary, and told him my cargo was all American property taken in at Boston, and consigned to an American gentleman, agent at Trinidad.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I then requested permission to go on board my vessel which was granted, and further requested Nickola should go with me, but was refused by the captain, who vociferated in a harsh manner, No, No, No.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I thought it not prudent to resist them, should they be pirates, with a crew of seven men, and only five muskets; accordingly ordered the arms and ammunition to be immediately stowed away in as secret a place as possible, and suffer her to speak us, hoping and believing that a republican flag indicated both honor and friendship from those who wore it, and which we might expect even from Spaniards.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I shall now proceed.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I mention our own, because it is doubted whether he was French or English, for we cannot trace him back to his origin.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have already noticed the marked intention of the Chinese historian, to paint the character of Paou in a poetical or epic manner.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I will assist you in every respect, it would be the means of securing your own happiness and the lives of all your adherents.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I am, said she, ten times stronger than Opotae, and government will perhaps, if I submit, act towards me as they have done with Opotae.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was witness myself to some of them producing five or six to obtain payment!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I offered the chief the three thousand, which he disdainfully refused, saying he was not to be played with; and unless they sent ten thousand dollars, and two large guns, with several casks of gunpowder, he would soon put us to death.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I accordingly wrote, and gave my letter to the man belonging to the boat before mentioned.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I assured him it was useless writing on these terms, and unless our ransom was speedily settled, the English fleet would sail, and render our enlargement altogether ineffectual.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have delivered all the bales that were given me into the Companys warehouse, for which the governor and council have ordered me a reward.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I procured also a hundred and twentynine bales of the Companys cloth, though they would not give me a rag of my own clothes.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I with some of my people made what haste I could to Kingstown, twentyfive miles from us, where I arrived next day, almost dead with the fatigue and loss of blood, having been sorely wounded in the head by a musketball.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I immediately went on board the Greenwich, where they seemed very diligent in preparation for an engagement, and I left Captain Kirby with mutual promises of standing by each other.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I particularly wanted to obtain the miniature picture, and offered the Mandoor fifty rupees if he could procure it; he laughed at me, and pointing significantly to his kris, drew one hand across my throat, and then across his own, giving me to understand such would be the result to us both on such an application to the rajah.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was now obliged to give the old Baudarre five rupees to take some care of me, as whilst walking about, the people not only thrust their hands into my pockets, but pulled the buttons from my clothes.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I did so, and was introduced to the rajah whom I found under a shed, with about 150 of his people; they were busy gambling, and had the appearance of what they really are, a ferocious set of banditti.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I should like to hear what the phrenologists say of his head; it appeared to me to be the most peculiar I had ever seen, and certainly, as far as the bump of destructiveness went, bore the theory fully out.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I never look at the place without feeling an involuntary sensation of horrorthe smoky and dirty nooksthe distant groups of dark Spaniards, Moors, and Jews, their sallow countenances made yellow by the fight of dim oil lampsthe unceiled rafters of the rooms above, seen through unshuttered windows and the consciousness of their having covered the atrocious Soto, combine this effect upon me.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I believe he is stated to be a Frenchman.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have drawn it from his trial, from the confession of his accomplices, from the keeper of his prison, and not a little from his own lips.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I cannot tell, but I believe the feelings of all of you would be the same, and that you would exclaim, with the Hebrew, My son!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have made a full and frank confession to Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I would to God that I never had been born, or that I had died in my infancy!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I hope it will please God to set you at your liberty, and that you may see the sins and follies of your life past.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I hope that you will reflect on your past, and fly to that Jesus who stands with open arms to receive you.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I am shortly to mount that scaffold, and to bid adieu to this world, and all that was ever dear to my breast.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was not in safety, neither had I rest; yet trouble came.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have nothing more to say.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have committed murder and I know I must die for it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I knew Church in Boston, and in a joke asked him how it was made up in the ships company; his reply, that it was he and Dawes.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I thought it was a joke, and paid no attention to it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I knew no more of this for some days.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have said enough.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have often understood that there is a great deal of difference in respect of color, and I have seen it in this Court.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I afterwards took passage to Marseilles, and thence to Boston.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I remained there until peace took place, then returned to Buenos Ayres, and thence to New York.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I sailed from Buenos Ayres, made two good cruises, and returned safely to port.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I remained on board the ship in the capacity of 5th Lieutenant, for about four months, during which time we had a number of skirmishes with the enemy.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have therefore deemed it proper to inquire into the cause of your living before this port without communicating your intention.","nextSentStartsWith":"but"},{"sentence":"I tender not only my own services to defend it, but those of all I command; and the only reward I ask, is, that a stop be put to the proscription

honor of your excellencys answer, which I am persuaded can be dictated only by wisdom.","nextSentStartsWith":"whos"},{"sentence":"I have never sailed under any flag but that of the republic of Carthagena, and my vessels are perfectly regular in that respect.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I am the stray sheep wishing to return to the fold.","nextSentStartsWith":"im"},{"sentence":"I offer to you to restore to this state several citizens, who perhaps in your eyes have lost that sacred title.","nextSentStartsWith":"in"},{"sentence":"I perceived that the pirates abandoned their vessels, and were flying in all directions.","nextSentStartsWith":"were"},{"sentence":"I readily assented.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I offered him the Mahometan salutation of peace, which he returned without hesitation.","nextSentStartsWith":"buenos"},{"sentence":"I was in the act of ordering the assault, when a white flag was displayed; and the enemy, after some little delay in

inform you, that the port of Galvezton belongs to and is in the possession of the republic of Texas, and was made a port of entry the 9th October last.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I told him I never would disgrace it, so long as I had a nerve in my arm.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I then bought one half of a new Baltimore schooner, and sailed again, but was captured seven days out, and carried into Rio Janeiro, where the Brazilians paid me my change.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I accordingly took passage from New York, in the Sally Ann, belonging to Bath, landed at Barcelona, crossed to Port Mahon, and endeavored to make my way to Algiers.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I will say a few words, but it is perhaps of no use.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have seen this.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I will say no more.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I refused at that time.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have had a fair prospect in the world, at last it budded, and brought forth the gallows.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I shall now close my letter with a few words which I hope you will receive as from a dying man; and I hope that every important truth of this letter may sink deep in your heart, and be a lesson to you through life.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I still remain your sincere friend, CHARLES GIBBS.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have occasion to pass the door frequently at night, for our barrack, (the Casement,) is but a few yards from it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I thought him more an object of pity than vengeance; he looked so worn with disease, so crushed with suffering, yet so affable, frank, and kind in his address; for he happened to be in a communicative mood, a thing that was by no means common with him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I witnessed his execution, and I believe there never was a more contrite man than he appeared to be; yet there were no drivelling fears upon himhe walked firmly at the tail of the fatal cart, gazing sometimes at his coffin, sometimes at the crucifix which he held in his hand.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I soon discovered the cause of their apprehension; they were jealous of Agi Bota, well knowing he would plunder me, and considered every article taken by him was so much lost to the Sultan of Coti, who naturally would expect the people to reserve me for his own particular plucking.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I then unmoored, got under sail, and brought two boats ahead to row me close to the Greenwich; but he being open to a valley and a breeze, made the best of his way from me; which an Ostender in our company, of twentytwo guns, seeing, did the same, though the captain had promised heartily to engage with us, and I believe would have been as good as his word, if Captain Kirby had kept his.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I am persuaded, had our consort the Greenwich done his duty, we had destroyed both of them, and got two hundred thousand pounds for our owners and selves; whereas the loss of the Cassandra may justly be imputed to his deserting us.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was then taken before the chief.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I told him to say we were Englishmen in distress, having been four days at sea without provisions.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was now summoned before the chief, who had been conversing with the interpreter: he said I must write to my captain, and tell him, if he did not send an hundred thousand dollars for our ransom, in ten days he would put us all to death.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have never been able to ascertain his reasons for detaining it, but suppose he dared not negociate for our ransom without orders from the head admiral, who I understood was sorry at our being captured.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I wrote to Captain Kay, and informed him of the chiefs determination, requesting, if an opportunity offered, to send us a shift of clothes, for which it may be easily imagined we were much distressed, having been seven weeks without a shift; although constantly exposed to the weather, and of course frequently wet.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I assured the interpreter I should give the men no such orders, that they must please themselves.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I must not omit to mention a most horrid (though ludicrous) circumstance which happened at this place.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had two very narrow escapes: the first, a twelve pounder shot fell within three or four feet of me; another took a piece out of a small brassswivel on which I was standing.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was so agitated at receiving this joyful news, that it was with difficulty I could scrawl about two or three lines to inform Lieutenant Maughn of the arrangements I had made.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have sworn it that I will destroy thee, wicked man, that I may do away with this soreness on my back.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I will then come out of my station and make an attack in front; the enemy being so taken in the front and rear, will, even supposing we cannot master him, certainly be thrown into disorder.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I know very well that Opotae could not come up to you, Sir; but I mean only, that since Opotae has made his submission, since he has got his pardon and been created a Government officer,how would it be, if you with your whole crew should also submit, and if his Excellency should desire to treat you in the same manner, and to give you the same rank as Opotae?","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I hope this digression, as it was in a manner needful, will be excused.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I tell you, replied Captain Holford, it is Vane the notorious pirate.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was then ordered to tack ship and lay by for the pirates boat to board me; which was done by Bolidar, their first lieutenant, with six or eight Spaniards armed with as many of the before mentioned weapons as they could well sling about their bodies.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was permitted to lie down in my berth; but, reader, if you have ever been awakened by a gang of armed, desperadoes, who have taken

were on board, and I thought they had; the truth was, I never had any bill of lading of the cider, and consequently had no recollection of its being on board; yet it served them as an excuse for being insolent.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was suffered to go below for the night, and they placed a guard over me, stationed at the companion way.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I then asked him how he came to be in such company, as he appeared to be dissatisfied.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was careful in examining the men, being desirous of knowing if any of my countrymen were among this wretched crew; but am satisfied there were none, and my Scotch friend concurred in the opinion.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was told by one of them, who could speak English, that Principe was a very large and populous town, situated at the head of St.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was informed by a line from Nickola, that the pirates had a man on board, a native of Principe, who, in the garb of a sailor, was a partner with Dominico, but I could not get sight of him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I understood they were waiting for boats to take the cargo; for the principal merchant had gone to Trinidad.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I afterwards heard that the flour only fetched five dollars per barrel, when it was worth at Trinidad thirteen; so that the villain who bought my cargo at Principe, made very large profits by it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I considered it imprudent to contend any longer, and submitted to his unlawful demand.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I saw from the companion way in the captains cabin my quadrant, spy glass and other things which belonged to us, and observed by the compass, that

observed that my friend Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I did not think conscience could be entirely extinguished in the human breast, or that men could become

Mexican.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I thought so too, and told him, I thought it most likely we should all die here soon; but as some one of us might survive to carry the tidings to our friends, if you have any thing to say respecting your family, now is the time.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I deemed it a providential thing to us, and urged Thomas and George trying the raft for her.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I hoped that a good Providence had yet preserved him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I knew them not.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I suspected it, I know what you were put here for.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I now thought again and again, with troubled emotion, of my dear friend Brackets fate.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I put the paper into a junk bottle, previously found on the beach, put in a stopper, and left it, together with what little flour remained, a keg of water brought from Nickolas vessel, and a few other things which I thought might be of service to him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I expressed a wish to take a look at the Exertion, possibly we might hear something of Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I gave them my warmest tribute of gratitude, saying I looked upon them under God as the preservers of our lives, and promised them all the assistance which my situation might enable me to afford.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was anxious to board her; accordingly took with me Nickola, Thomas, George and two others, well armed, each with a musket and cutlass.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I thought we had better heave to.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I also applied to the governor, and exerted myself with peculiar interest, dictated as I trust with heartfelt gratitudeand I ardently hope ere this, that Nickola is on his way to this country, where I may have an opportunity of convincing him that such an act of benevolence will not go unrewarded.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I heard nothing from him, until I believe eighteen months after I reached home, when I received a letter from him, from Montego Bay, Jamaica, informing me that he was then residing in that island.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could not show that this was the truth, and therefore they have judged me by the people they have found me

white.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I remember the appearance of his  coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before  the end, was nothing but patches.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I  followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright  doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and  pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all,  with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting,  far gone in rum, with his arms on the table.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I paused where I was, with my napkin in my  hand.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for

asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and  whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering,  clumsy

holding out the note.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I see.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I dont rightly know, sir, answered Morgan.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I knew that blind man too.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship  for that

news.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of Spanish wine  and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig  on his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he was agitated.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the whole  details of Silvers conversation.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I own  myself an ass, and I await your orders.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I never heard of a  crew that meant to mutiny but

Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I did think I could have trusted Hands, added the captain.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I volunteered for one of  the boats, where I had, of course, no business.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone  briskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the  island had relaxed the cords of discipline.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I observed the doctor sniffing  and sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I get a rough  answer, do I not?","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd,  outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an  open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with  a few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak  in growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I turned hither and thither among the  trees.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty

 one of the honest handswell, here, at that same moment, came news of  another.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but  it instantly awoke my fears.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I might be  discovered.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his  features were even pleasing.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and  I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the  statement hotly: Rich!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I says.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him  the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found  ourselves.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I am sure he would, said I.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I were in Flints ship when he buried the treasure; he and  six alongsix strong seamen.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I keep her under the white rock.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was thinking this over when  there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of  death.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I found them all shaken, as was natural.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the details  of its accomplishment.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had half a  mind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver  and the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost  by trying for too much.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have my watch here in my hand; I give you thirty seconds to join  me in.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could hear as well as see that brandyfaced rascal Israel Hands  plumping down a roundshot on the deck.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my  priming.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first, he replied.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if we  were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us, but  neither sooner nor later.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was pretty  far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east,  and is joined at halfwater to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my  feet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among  low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in  colour.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I do not know, sir, said I.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with  a cry of surprise, Silver himself!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on  to be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had already deserted  my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated  himself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his  hands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron  kettle in the sand.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I dont deny it was a good lay.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I stand here and tell  you so; and theyre the last good words youll get from me, for in the  name of heaven, Ill put a bullet in your back when next I meet you.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I pitched it in  redhot on purpose; and before the hours out, as he said, we shall be  boarded.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I told you so!","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I saw the three flashestwo close togetherone farther to the  west.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I take it, replied I, the doctor has his idea; and if I am right,  hes going now to see Ben Gunn.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a foolish,  overbold act; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in  my power.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I  was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east  from the open sea, find the white rock I had observed last evening, and  ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat,  a thing quite worth doing, as I still believe.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for I was  determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of  observation from the anchorage.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment, till, thinking  I was now got far enough to the south, I took the cover of some thick  bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but  I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunns  boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever  made by man.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had quite made up my mind that the  mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their  hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be  a fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their  watchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little  risk.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near  enough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded  the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious,  encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and I shut my  eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I opened my eyes at once.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was scarce a quarter of a  mile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront  such perils.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward  along the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from my  position that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leave  Haulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to  land upon the kindlierlooking Cape of the Woods.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old  position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led  me as softly as before among the billows.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks  from shore or from a vessels deck, was for all the world like any range  of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was,  indeed, close in.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was  so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad  or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion,  surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing  but stare and wonder.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could not choose but suppose she was deserted.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could see the waves boiling white under  her forefoot.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was on the summit of one  swell when the schooner came stooping over the next.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under  water.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles  a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I asked him.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I reckon, he said at last, I reckon, Capn Hawkins, youll kind of  want to get ashore now.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I can see, cant I?","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was greatly elated with my new command, and pleased with the bright,  sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I should, I think, have had nothing left me to desire but for  the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck  and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I  knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution  possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more  into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now,  with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am  very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about  and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that  were a pleasure to behold.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a  sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I cursed myself for my neglect.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had no time to try my other pistol, nor  indeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot  below me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands  with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of  surprise and disappointment.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a cock  upon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand over his  shoulder.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I clung with both hands till my nails ached, and I shut my eyes as if to  cover up the peril.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I went below and did what I could for my wound; it pained me a good deal  and still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it  greatly gall me when I used my arm.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I began to see a danger to the ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I remembered that the most easterly  of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidds anchorage ran from the  twopeaked hill upon my left, and I bent my course in that direction  that I might pass the stream while it was small.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I looked up; a pale glimmer  of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spyglass, and soon after  I saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, and  knew the moon had risen.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I could only judge that all had  perished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not been there to  perish with them.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among  the woods in the great attack, and doubted not that this was he.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I see you were smart when first I set my  eyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean, it do.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I always  wanted you to jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my  cock, youve got to.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I  wont say no.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land,  and I heard you, John, and you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at  the bottom of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was  out.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I like that boy, now; I never seen  a better boy than that.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and  be hanged into the bargain.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I says to  myself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkinsll stand by you.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I began dimly to understand.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was askinghe, the  old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I never much believed in neither of THEM.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I ask no questions, nor I wont let others.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I need a caulker, for theres  trouble on hand.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I wont eat you.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I  know the rules, I do; I wont hurt a depytation.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I thought so, he observed.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I dunno, but its pretty plain  they wanted it.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I reckon tailors is your trade.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I reckon so, said the seacook.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I think it most  probablethough of course its only an opinionthat youll all have  the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I readily gave the pledge required.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I will own that I here began to weep.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I have blamed myself enough; my lifes forfeit anyway, and I should  have been dead by now if Silver hadnt stood for me; and doctor,  believe this, I can dieand I dare say I deserve itbut what I fear is  torture.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I know, I know, he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I can  only, asking your pardon, save my life and the boys by seeking for that  treasure; and you may lay to that.","nextSentStartsWith":"gray"},{"sentence":"I never in my life saw men so careless of  the morrow; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way  of doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they  were bold enough for a brush and be done with it, I could see their  entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged
