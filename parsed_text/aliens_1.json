them.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was just as well for  them, for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have  broken every bone in their

seem they were regarding this new  antagonist with astonishment.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more  amazed than terrified,

difficulty they could get her down to the  beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the  attention of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that  duty alternately with my brother.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was the

revolver all this time, but it had been under the  seat when she and her companion were attacked.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford,

steam.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It struck the tower of Shepperton  Church, smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have  done, swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force  into the river out of my sight.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates  of the 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the  artilleryman told me was a heliograph.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It  would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It seems there were a few people alive  there, frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was

round the edge of the common that any  disturbance was perceptible.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was dark, and suddenly void of men.","nextSentStartsWith":"perhaps"},{"sentence":"It

frantic, fantastic!","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It had a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness  like summer lightning.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was a most unexceptional morning.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was nearly eleven when I started to return.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was an elusive visiona moment  of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red  masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of  the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear

of a head looking about.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was some  time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to  a drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It  was very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming  infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in  columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on  firea broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and  writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red  reflection upon the cloudscud above.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It reminded me, more than anything

guidance.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the  afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second  and third

quite  desolate under the hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of  flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It  was curious, my

panic.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,  after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank  down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather  liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the  valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the  carbonicacid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It hung together  in banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving  reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist  and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him  quiet with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the  slender ladys arm.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting  point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust  was hot and pungent.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It had no character of its own.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was a carriage, with  a pole for a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It is Lord Garrick.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It is  possible that a very considerable number of people in London stuck to  their houses through Monday morning.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was the only warship in sight, but far  away to the right over the smooth surface of the seafor that day  there was a dead calmlay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next  ironclads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line,  steam up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the  course of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent  it.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was about two oclock when my brother, having paid their fares  at the gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his  charges.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was the torpedo ram, Thunder Child, steaming headlong,  coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was probably her  not firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was the first

blinding glare  of vivid green light.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was not like the HeatRay, I said, and for a time I was  inclined to think one of the great fightingmachines had stumbled  against the house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of  Shepperton Church.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It  was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been called  handlingmachines, and the study of which has already given such an  enormous impetus to terrestrial invention.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of  quasiscientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did  forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian  condition.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It spread up  the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment,  and its cactuslike branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of  our triangular window.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It seemed  infinitely more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in the  sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving  feebly after their vast journey across space.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It piped  and whistled as it worked.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It grew upon my mind, once I could  face the facts, that terrible as our position was, there was as yet  no justification for absolute despair.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw  the lad killed.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that  at first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought  about by their overthrow through any human effort.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was the eleventh day  before I ventured so far from my security.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It is you, said he; the man from

the facts point to.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It may  be in my time, eventhose men.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was the coal cellar of the place, and when I  saw the

powers.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It was  strange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing  water for their propagation.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"It

kitchen.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I thought at once that it would infer  my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the  scullery door.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I stood petrified, staring.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  looked up and saw the lower surface of a handlingmachine coming  slowly across the hole.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I must bear my witness!","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I defied him, although I felt no assurance  that he might not do this thing.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I preached acceptable follymy God,  what folly!","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I would not let  him eat any more that day.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a  bottle of burgundy.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I went back  quickly and quietly into the scullery.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I went into the scullery, removed the  door, and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as  possible; but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the  loose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I also weighed very carefully the possibility of our  digging a way out in a direction away from the pit, but the chances of  our emerging within sight of some sentinel fightingmachine seemed at  first too great.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I could see his  staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I crouched, watching this fightingmachine closely, satisfying  myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a  Martian.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with  all my ears.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I take no credit to  myself for an accident, but the fact is so.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first  pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we  crouched motionless.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine  shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I listened again.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was insensible for a long  time, the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness  again, and he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from  a cut forehead, was dabbing water over me.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I give this  catalogue so precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to  subsist upon this store for the next fortnight.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I went through a shrubbery,  and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds,  and so emerged upon the road towards Kew.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap,  pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I have an impression that many of the houses  here were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even  for flight.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off  from her, of all that might happen to her in my absence.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  have set forth at length in the last chapter my brothers account of  the road through Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise  how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concerned.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I dare not leave my people.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I cant go on!","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now  moving eastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such  evidence of its work.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was so excited by these heavy minuteguns following one another  that I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to  clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I come from Byfleet, he said; man on a bicycle came through the  place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to  come away.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday  morning all London was electrified by the news from Woking.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I saw it happen.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I ceased my laboured  reasoning, struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand  on his shoulder.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I answered, clearing my throat.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I stared at him and made no answer.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  dare say he found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my  watersoaked trousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders  blackened by the smoke.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I asked abruptly.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I became aware of him as a seated figure in sootsmudged  shirt sleeves, and with his upturned, cleanshaven face staring at  a faint flickering that danced over the sky.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  seem to remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last  spurt.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I suppose the time was then about four or five  oclock.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I expected nothing but death.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I splashed through the tumultuous water,  pushing aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the  bend.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I saw  people struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting  faintly above the seething and roar of the Martians collapse.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I saw and thought nothing of the  other four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer  incident.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I shouted, unheeded.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking  fountain, made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with  us.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I shouted.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was explainin these is vallyble.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I do, I said; and he turned his horse southward again.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active  service and he knew better than that.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was hurt across the back by the fall of  the horse, and there I had to lie until I felt better.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I lay still, he said, scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter  of a horse atop of me.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I could not see his face.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I heard a slight scraping at the  fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I  looked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I began to  compare the things to human machines, to ask myself for the first time  in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an  intelligent lower animal.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I began to ask myself what they could  be.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  got up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some  whiskey, and then I was moved to change my clothes.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I made my  way by the police station and the College Arms towards my own house.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I went close up to the fence on the left and  worked my way along its palings.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I say splashed,  for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy  torrent.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as  much motive as I had.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people  hear (if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted,  and, availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way,  succeeded in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into  the pine woods towards Maybury.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  have no doubt this Thing in the field was the third of the ten  cylinders they had fired at us from Mars.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I felt a tug at the  reins.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated  the conflict.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wifes  fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I can best express my state of mind by saying  that I wanted to be in at the death.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave  him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that  quivering tumult.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my  attention to the horse.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I went in again, according to my promise, to  get my servants box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail  of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the  drivers seat beside my wife.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I shouted after him:    What news?","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I must have a pound, said the landlord, and Ive no one to drive  it.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what  was going on behind his house.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I thought perplexed.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this  preparation, greatly excited me.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I described the HeatRay to them, and they  began to argue among themselves.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I talked with these soldiers  for a time; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous  evening.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then  strolled in to breakfast.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I heard the rattle of his chariot and I  went round to the side gate to ask the latest news.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I went into my garden before breakfast  and stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring  but a lark.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I remember that dinner  table with extraordinary vividness even now.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I said.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I felt foolish and angry.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  stopped at the group of people.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I do not know how far my  experience is common.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I answered his greeting with a  meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I asked myself  had these latter things indeed happened?","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was immediately the self of every day againa decent,  ordinary citizen.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I must have remained there some time.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I came into the road between  the crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.","nextSentStartsWith":"."},{"sentence":"I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits  and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled.","nextSentStartsWith":"unfortunately,"},{"sentence":"I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping  from man to man in that little distant crowd.","nextSentStartsWith":"not"},{"sentence":"I saw a  lad trundling off the barrow of apples.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I said; but he made no answer to  that.","nextSentStartsWith":"they"},{"sentence":"I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,  seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand  heaps that hid these newcomers to our earth.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I was a battleground  of fear and curiosity.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I had a momentary impulse to  go back and help him that my fears overruled.","nextSentStartsWith":"we"},{"sentence":"I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith  another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the  aperture.","nextSentStartsWith":"fancy"},{"sentence":"I stood petrified and staring.","nextSentStartsWith":"if"},{"sentence":"I found  myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running  off, Stent among them.","nextSentStartsWith":"dont"},{"sentence":"I saw astonishment giving place to  horror on the faces of the people about me.","nextSentStartsWith":"we"},{"sentence":"I know  I did.","nextSentStartsWith":"let"},{"sentence":"I had the sunset in my eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"ive"},{"sentence":"I stuck  my elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the  Thing again.","nextSentStartsWith":"there"},{"sentence":"I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,  standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again.","nextSentStartsWith":"it"},{"sentence":"I heard a peculiar humming sound from the  pit.","nextSentStartsWith":"for"},{"sentence":"I went on to the crowd.","nextSentStartsWith":"it"},{"sentence":"I dont like it.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I failed to  find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from  London by the six oclock train from Waterloo; and as it was then  about a quarter past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to  the station to waylay him.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I clambered  into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet.","nextSentStartsWith":"everyone"},{"sentence":"I fancy the popular expectation of  a heap of charred corpses was

Chronicle.","nextSentStartsWith":"my"},{"sentence":"I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my  French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I  loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it.","nextSentStartsWith":"a"},{"sentence":"I wished I  had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute  gleam I had seen

Ottershaw.","nextSentStartsWith":"a"},{"sentence":"I am inclined to  think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in  the vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shots were fired  at us.","nextSentStartsWith":"a"},{"sentence":"I never dreamed of  it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring  missile.","nextSentStartsWith":"in"},{"sentence":"I saw

eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"can"},{"sentence":"I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph  of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"I myself heard nothing of that.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"I was  naturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the  Ottershaw bridge to the sand pits.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"I have already described the  appearance of that colossal bulk, embedded in the

the gravel with a ringing concussion.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I think everyone expected to see a man emergepossibly something a  little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man.","nextSentStartsWith":"fancy"},{"sentence":"I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,  from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my  way back from the edge of the pit.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"I heard inarticulate  exclamations on all sides.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"I looked again at the cylinder, and  ungovernable terror gripped me.","nextSentStartsWith":"thats"},{"sentence":"I turned and, running madly, made for

perplexed.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I could not credit it.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I dare say I staggered drunkenly.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was

seen.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I went into  the dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could  collect myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had  told me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves  on the earth.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner I was to  eat for very many strange and terrible days.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to  whom I spoke.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in  sleeping, and I rose early.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I repeated my description.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I did not succeed in getting a  glimpse of the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were  in the hands of the military authorities.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  found people in the town quite secure again in the presence of the  military, and I heard for the first time from Marshall, the  tobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the common.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the  day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took  a cold bath in the afternoon.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I learned that the smouldering  pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled,  in the hope of destroying that object before it opened.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I and my wife stood amazed.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I shouted above the sudden noise.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the  hill would be moving.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the  dog cart.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I took care to have the cart there and  then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife  and servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such  plate as we had, and so forth.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I ran to my neighbours door and rapped to satisfy myself of  what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had  locked up their house.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I saw  the doctors cart ahead of me.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and  Send.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I talked to her reassuringly,  pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer  heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but  she answered only in monosyllables.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was even afraid  that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of  our invaders from Mars.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill,  nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping  securely, or deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the  terror of the night.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a  thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling  into the field to my left.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in  the water, under a clump of furze.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I struggled to my feet at  last, and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a  run for this.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I staggered through the trees, fell into a  ditch and bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out  into the lane that ran down from the College Arms.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I stood over him waiting for the next  flash.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  sprang to my feet.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  let myself in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door,  staggered to the foot of the staircase, and sat down.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall,  shivering violently.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I stopped short in the doorway.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I could not see what they were doing, nor the  clear form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied  upon.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the  door again.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I began to see his face, blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was  also.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was still standing on the bank by the side of the road.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I shall go on, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I stopped and gripped his arm.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I said, pointing at the pine tops  that hid the Martians.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  turned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified for  thought.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian,  rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I gave a cry of astonishment.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I  turned shoreward.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded,  agonised, I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the  shore.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I fell  helplessly, in full sight of the Martians, upon the broad, bare  gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a  score of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel,  whirling it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense,  and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade between  them, now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke,  receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of  river and meadow.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting downstream;  and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it,  gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I followed the river, because I considered that the water  gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without  meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no  more water.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably  I dozed.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was walking through the roads to clear my brain, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I said, in a matteroffact tone.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I began to explain my view of our position.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I began to understand the position.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I proceeded to tell him.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I told him it was the heliograph signallingthat it was the sign  of human help and effort in the sky.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I cant go on!","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I figured her at  Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I grew very  weary and irritable with the curates perpetual ejaculations; I tired  of the sight of his selfish despair.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I resolved to leave himwould that I had!","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I had found oil  and rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that  I found in one of the bedrooms.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I did not know what these  werethere was no time for scrutinyand I put a more horrible  interpretation on them than they deserved.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I suppose it was nearly eleven oclock before we gathered courage  to start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along  hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the  darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who  seemed to be all about us.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was knocked headlong across the floor  against the oven handle and stunned.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I sat up.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I heard him presently whimpering to himself.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I could just see the curates face, a dim,  oval shape, and his collar and cuffs.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I am inclined to  believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that  awakening.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way  towards the pantry.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I whispered  for the curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of  the kitchen.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I touched the curates leg, and he started so violently that a mass  of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I have myself seen  this being done, as I shall mention in its place.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I have a certain claim to  at least an elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I  am convincedas firmly as I am convinced of anythingthat the  Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I turned to a  scowling face, and silent, eloquent lips.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands  over my ears, and bolted into the scullery.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I lost  heart, and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time, having no  spirit even to move.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was  that made me listen.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I was struck by a sudden thought.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I divided the  food in the pantry, into rations to last us ten days.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I implored.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I have been still too long, he said, in a tone that must have  reached the pit, and now I must bear my witness.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the  Martians should hear us.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I go!","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the

face.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He had a vague idea that he might see something of me.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at  the evident magnitude of the trouble.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He thought of  all those silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside;  he tried to imagine boilers on

pluckily pulled up and returned to his help.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon  living at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous  case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the  Martian advance.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He  stopped behind to tell the neighbours.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He promised to stay with  them, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the  missing man arrived, and professed to be an expert

friends.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He gave a shriek and dodged  back, and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He released his grip on the  fallen man and jumped back.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with  all a childs want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated  eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed  under the rolling wheels.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"he shouted, and began  turning the pony round.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He turned to Miss Elphinstone,  suddenly resolute.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He heard that about half the  members of the government had gathered at Birmingham, and that  enormous quantities of high explosives were being prepared to be used  in automatic mines across the Midland counties.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He was so fascinated by  this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes  for anything seaward.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards  from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of  a plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge  waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles  helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the  waterline.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He held it pointing obliquely downward,  and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He used no HeatRay to  destroy them, but picked them up one by one.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He pointed outwriting in a foolish, facetious tonethat the  perfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs;  the perfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as  hair, external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential  parts of the human being, and that the tendency of natural selection  would lie in the direction of their steady diminution through the  coming ages.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He was as lacking in  restraint as a silly woman.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He ate and drank  impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that  we were observed, crouched in a spasm of terror.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He was a stout, ruddy,  middleaged man, well dressed; three days before, he must have been  walking the world, a man of considerable consequence.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He  vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He would neither desist from his attacks on the food  nor from his noisy babbling to himself.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"he would say, over and over again.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He began to  raise his voiceI prayed him not to.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed  expression.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He put out  a hand, and I took it.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He saw my face, and halted awkwardly.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He  seemed to hesitate whether to apologise, met my eyes, and went on:  Theres food all about here.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He paused.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He hesitated.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He put down his spade.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He grew enthusiastic.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He became suddenly very generous, and when we had  eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He was inclined to regard my coming  as a great occasion.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He taught me euchre, and after dividing  London between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we  played for parish points.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He was no longer the energetic regenerator of his species I had  encountered in the morning.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any  provocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness  of power.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He remembered a  golden rather than a reddish tinge in it, but that had been under the  yellow sun of Earth; under the scarlet sun of this planet, it took on a  different beauty.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He tried to sound confident.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He had met her only a couple of months before the
