servingmen.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The scientific attainments of Professor Summerlee are too well known  for me to trouble to recapitulate

turned to bronze,  listening intently with expressions of terror upon their faces.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The Indians know.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The Mongolian theory I regard with  deep suspicion.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The Indians carried first our canoes and then our stores  through the brushwood, which is very thick at this point, while we four  whites, our rifles on our shoulders, walked between them and any danger  coming from the woods.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The place was horribly haunted by clouds of mosquitoes and  every form of flying pest, so we were glad to find solid ground again  and to make a circuit among the trees, which enabled us to outflank  this pestilent morass, which droned like an organ in the distance, so  loud was it with insect life.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The vegetation had again changed, and only the  vegetable ivory tree remained, with a great profusion of wonderful  orchids, among which I learned to recognize the rare Nuttonia  Vexillaria and the glorious pink and scarlet blossoms of Cattleya and  odontoglossum.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The crags above us were not merely perpendicular,  but curved outwards at the top, so that ascent was out of the question.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The ground at the foot of the cliff was rocky and broken so that the  going was slow and difficult.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The beetling head of  the cliff projected over the canebrake.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The cave had evidently been waterworn, the sides being smooth and the  floor covered with rounded stones.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The roof has fallen in!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The only effect was that  the larger ones became detached and threatened to roll down the  gradient and crush us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The road by which Maple  White had ascended was no longer available.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The line of cliffs, which had decreased  considerably in height, had already begun to trend from west to north,  and if we could take this as representing the arc of a circle, the  whole circumference could not be very great.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The next instant  it was goneand so was our dinner.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The cliffs upon the farther side had lost their ruddy tint, being  chocolatebrown in color; the vegetation was more scattered along the  top of

somewhere, I repeated.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The only drawback is that we  have conclusively proved by ocular demonstration that there are no  water channels down the rocks.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The place which Maple Whites chalkmarks had  indicated as his own means of access was now entirely impassable.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The rock was harder than marble,  and any attempt at cutting a path for so great a height was more than  our time or resources would admit.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  problem is solved.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The first impression which I received when I had recovered my breath  was of the extraordinary view over the country which we had traversed.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The level of the plateau, when I turned, was exactly that on which we  stood, and the green bank of bushes, with occasional trees, was so near  that it was difficult to realize how inaccessible it remained.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The wall was  absolutely precipitous, as was that which faced me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The tree was a good sixty feet in  height, and if it only fell the right way it would easily cross the  chasm.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The severed  trunk rolled to the very edge of our platform, and for one terrible  second we all thought it was over.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The remonstrance was too reasonable to be disregarded.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The climb was a more simple  thing now that the rope dangled down the face of the worst part of the  ascent.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The halfbreeds had ascended also, and under Lord Johns orders they  had carried up a bale of provisions in case our first exploration  should be a long one.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The bridge was gone!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The face had vanished,  but presently it was up again, more frantic than before.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The halfbreed was  descending on the farther side of the pinnacle; but before he could  reach the ground Lord John had run along the edge of the plateau and  gained a point from which he could see his man.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The more I think the more desperate does our position seem.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The rope, of course, is far too short  that we could descend by it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The first  incident in it was not such as to give me a very favorable opinion of  the place to which we had wandered.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The firstfruits of our labors, said Challenger in his booming,  pedantic fashion.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  very small inconvenience of being bitten, my young friend, cannot, I am  sure, weigh with you as against the glorious privilege of having your  name inscribed in the deathless roll of zoology.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The beech,  the oak, and even the birch were to be found among the tangle of trees  which girt us in.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The peaceful penetration of Maple White Land was the pressing subject  before us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  strength of the parents seemed to be limitless, for one of them, having  some difficulty in reaching a bunch of foliage which grew upon a  considerablesized tree, put his forelegs round the trunk and tore it  down as if it had been a sapling.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The incident made it  think, apparently, that the neighborhood was dangerous, for it slowly  lurched off through the wood, followed by its mate and its three  enormous infants.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The South of England was  alive with them when there was plenty of good lush greenstuff to keep  them going.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The place was a rookery of pterodactyls.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The brutes mean mischief.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The gate of Fort  Challenger had been untouched, the walls were unbroken, and yet it had  been visited by some strange and powerful creature in our absence.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The two professors, their tempers aggravated  no doubt by their injuries, had fallen out as to whether our assailants  were of the genus pterodactylus or dimorphodon, and high words had  ensued.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The crash of a gun in  this silent night would be heard for miles.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The thing moved forward  with a dreadful snarl.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The iguanodon glade  was the scene of a horrible butchery.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  indications would be consistent with the presence of a sabertoothed  tiger, such as are still found among the breccia of our caverns; but  the creature actually seen was undoubtedly of a larger and more  reptilian character.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The Professor only raised his great eyebrows, as the schoolmaster meets  the irrelevant observation of the naughty boy.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The homely English  bee buzzed everywhere around us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The problem of the descent is at first sight a formidable one, said  he, and yet I cannot doubt that the intellect can solve it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The eyes, which were under thick and heavy  brows, were bestial and ferocious, and as it opened its mouth to snarl  what sounded like a curse at me I observed that it had curved, sharp  canine teeth.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The whole theory of telepathy began Summerlee, filling his pipe.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The question which we have to face is whether he  approaches more closely to the ape or the man.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The solution of this problem is our immediate duty.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The fleshpots of civilization, groaned Challenger.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The full moon  was shining brightly, and the air was crisply cold.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The trees grew so thickly and their  foliage spread so widely that I could see nothing of the moonlight  save that here and there the high branches made a tangled filigree  against the starry sky.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The night had been exceedingly still, but as I advanced I became  conscious of a low, rumbling sound, a continuous murmur, somewhere in  front of me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The ground shook beneath  his tremendous weight, and his gulpings of water resounded through the  still night.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The path lay still behind me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The post in the  center, some nine feet long, was sharpened at the upper end, and was  black with the stale blood of the creatures who had been impaled upon  it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The sloping wall of the pit was not difficult for an active man to  climb, but I hesitated long before I trusted myself within reach of the  dreadful creature which had so nearly destroyed me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The zareba  rose before me, even as I had left it, but the gate was open.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The blankets of Challenger and of Summerlee beside the fire  suggested that they had been asleep at the time.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The more  I tried to think it out with my confused and weary brain the less could  I find any plausible explanation.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The Indian could bear this back to the world.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  apemen laughed tooor at least they put up the devil of a  cacklinand they set to work to drag us off through the forest.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The apemen put two  of them to death there and thenfairly pulled the arm off one of  themit was perfectly beastly.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The only chance was to get the guns and try a rescue.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The edge of the plateau has fewer large trees  than further inland.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The woods seemed to be  full of the apemen; again and again we heard their curious clicking  chatter.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The openings of these huts and the branches of the trees were thronged  with a dense mob of apepeople, whom from their size I took to be the  females and infants of the tribe.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The remains of his coat still hung in strips  from his shoulders, but his shirt had been all torn out, and his great  beard merged itself in the black tangle which covered his mighty chest.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The dense mob of apemen ran about in bewilderment, marveling whence  this storm of death was coming or what it might mean.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The Indian looked up at him, and then, with a little yelp,  cringed to the ground and clung to Lord Johns leg.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The question before us is what are we  to do with these Indians?","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The lobes of their ears,  hanging ragged and bloody, showed that they had been pierced for some  ornaments which their captors had torn out.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The type of these people, said he in his sonorous fashion, whether  judged by cranial capacity, facial angle, or any other test, cannot be  regarded as a low one; on the contrary, we must place it as  considerably higher in the scale than many South American tribes which  I can mention.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  young chief walked at our head as our guide, but refused indignantly to  carry any burden.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The little red warriors hung upon the words of the speaker, and when he  had finished they burst into a roar of applause, waving their rude  weapons in the air.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The old fellow clasped our hands, each in turn, while his men cheered  louder than ever.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The sandbanks far out were spotted with uncouth  crawling forms, huge turtles, strange saurians, and one great flat  creature like a writhing, palpitating mat of black greasy leather,  which flopped its way slowly to the lake.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The others, screaming and clawing, were thrust over  the precipice, and went hurtling down, as their prisoners had of old,  on to the sharp bamboos six hundred feet below.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The males were exterminated, Ape Town was destroyed, the females and  young were driven away to live in bondage, and the long rivalry of  untold centuries had reached its bloody end.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The debbil get you sure if you stay up there.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The openings were about eighty feet above the ground, and were led up  to by long stone stairs, so narrow and steep that no large animal could  mount them.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The wretched Indians screamed with terror, but were helpless, run as  they would, before the relentless purpose and horrible activity of  these monstrous creatures.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The other bounded round in an eccentric  circle with shrill, wailing cries, and then lying down writhed in agony  for some minutes before it also stiffened and lay still.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  Indians were so terrified at it that they would not go near the place,  and, though we twice made expeditions and saw it each time, we could  not make our way through the deep marsh in which it lived.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The car will be my next care.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The inflated membrane shot up with frightful velocity  into the air.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The end wall was exactly like the side ones.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The moon, by George!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The rescue party  had arrived.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  entrance of the four heroes of the occasion was the signal for a  remarkable demonstration of welcome, the whole audience rising and  cheering for some minutes.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"THE CHAIRMAN:  Yes, sir, if there must be an amendment.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The attitude of the greater part of the public might be  described as one of attentive neutrality.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The cries of the people  in the galleries, who were alarmed at the near approach of those  glowing eyes and that murderous beak, excited the creature to a frenzy.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The window!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The closepacked throng  extended from the other side of the Langham Hotel to Oxford Circus.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The reader will remember how I met Lord John Roxton upon the very  occasion when, in his protective crinoline, he had gone to bring the  Devils chick as he called it, for Professor Challenger.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The next day it came  out in the evening papers that Private Miles, of the Coldstream Guards,  on duty outside Marlborough House, had deserted his post without leave,  and was therefore courtmartialed.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The only other evidence which I can adduce is from  the log of the SS.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The expression of her eyes, the hard upward stare, the set  of the lips, was new to me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The vessel rocked as  though the sea beneath it had been uptorn by a mighty volcano.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The silence which followed the detonation of the exploding torpedo was  almost equally horrifying.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The officer in command ordered us to lower our  flag, but this the captain of the liner refused to do.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The deck was  tilting to an impossible angle.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The sea was littered with wreckage  among which floated the pitiful forms of women and children, buoyed up  by their useless lifebelts.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The vision smiled wanly.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  old scalawag just closed his eyes and put on one of the softest  sugarwouldntmeltinmymouth expressions you ever saw and stood  there taking it and asking for more.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The tug came close beside us, and a man on deck threw us a rope.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The rough men were gentle as mothers with the  girl.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The best I did  was to scrape alongside the sub.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The first thing I heard was  Nobs barking furiously; evidently he had missed me and was searching.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The merchantman will flee  us; the warvessel will destroy us; neither will believe our colors or  give us a chance to explain.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  moment the engine started to turn, however, there was a grinding sound  of tortured steel, and when it had been stopped, we found that some one  had placed a coldchisel in one of the gears.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The night before the repairs were completed, the sentry came  to my room and awoke me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The spirits of the men seemed  improved; everything seemed propitious.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The storm was still raging; nor did it  abate its fury until the fourth day.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The conclusion was obvious.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The first thing von Schoenvorts did was to send for me and announce  that as a pirate I was to be shot early the next morning.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The very first day we entered the South Pacific we had an adventure.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The last was a  peremptory command that made me jump.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The cruiser lay dead  ahead.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The girl was just below me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The U33 trembled from stem to stern as the torpedo shot from its  tube.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The Baron was no match for me in  a handtohand encounter, and I soon had him pinned to the deck and the  life almost choked out of him.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The Geier had sunk while we were still battling upon  our deck, and afterward we had drawn away toward the north, leaving the  survivors to the attention of the single boat which had been making its  way toward us when Olson launched the torpedo.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The sea seemed to be getting heavier, for every  wave now washed completely over the lower deck.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The water was halfway up the conningtower!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The top  of the conningtower was now awash.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The two shots awakened everyone, and as our men were  armed, the result was inevitable as you see it; but it would have been  very different had it not been for Miss La Rue.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The wind, which had been blowing fitfully from the  east, suddenly veered around into the south, and presently we felt a  sudden chill.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The land before us might have been a continent,  so mighty appeared the shoreline; yet we knew that we must be thousands  of miles from the nearest western landmassNew Zealand or Australia.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The surf was not heavy, and there was no undertow, so we made shore  easily, effecting an equally easy landing.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The creature must have been about  the height of a fair sized man; its features were similar to those of a  man; yet had it been a man?","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The balance of that day we spent in continuing a minute and fruitless  exploration of the monotonous coast.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The branch was carried down by a river, and we are going to find that  river.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The water was very warm,  and it was fresh, but there was a most unpleasant taste to it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The waters grew suddenly lighter, and my spirits rose  accordingly.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The instant the deck was awash, I opened the conningtower hatch and  stepped out.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The thing must have been sixteen or eighteen feet in length and closely  resembled pictures I had seen of restored plesiosaurs of the lower  Jurassic.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The bullet  struck the thing in the neck, just above its body; but instead of  disabling it, merely increased its rage.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The creatures were approaching perilously close before I dropped  through the hatchway and slammed down the cover.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The narrow table was unfolded; the four  stools were set out; and for the first time in days we sat down to eat,  and for the first time in weeks we had something to eat other than the  monotony of the short rations of an impoverished Uboat.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The grass, too, was less flowering, though there  were still gorgeous patches mottling the greensward; and lastly, the  fauna was less multitudinous.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The waters all about us were alive with life.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The water of the inland sea was very warm, almost hot, and the  atmosphere was hot and heavy above it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  encircling walls, the central lake, the hot springs which feed the lake,  all point to such a conclusion, and the fauna and the flora bear  indisputable evidence that Caprona was once part of some great landmass.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The four of us were  to constitute a military court under which men might be tried and  sentenced to punishment for infraction of military rules and  discipline, even to the passing of the deathsentence.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The first thing we did was to taste the water of the little  streamwhich, to our delight, we found sweet, pure and cold.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The scaly body was covered with black and yellow spots  about a foot in diameter and irregular in contour.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The underside of the  chest, body and tail were a greenish white.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The thing raised its head and looked  about until its eyes rested upon us; then it gave vent to a most  appalling hiss that rose to the crescendo of a terrific shriek and came  for us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The  creature was quite dead, and an examination resulted in disclosing the  fact that Whitelys bullet had pierced its heart, and mine had severed  the spinal cord.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The thing was dead when your bullets  struck it; but it did not know it for several secondspossibly a  minute.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The interior of a Uboat is  about as impossible and uncomfortable an abidingplace as one can well  imagine, and in this warm climate, and in warm water, it was almost  unendurable.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The others followed him,  and in a minute we should have been overwhelmed.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The others hesitated a moment and then broke for the  trees, some running nimbly among the branches, while others lost  themselves to us between the boles.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The thing appeared to be some variety  of pterodactyl, and what with its enormous size and ferocious aspect  was most aweinspiring.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The Neanderthal man was something of a care,  for we had to keep him in irons all the time, and he was mighty savage  when approached; but after a time he became more docile, and then we  tried to discover if he had a language.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The second day we marched about ten miles to the foot of the cliffs.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The cur had broken  his every pledge and was leaving us there to our fates.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"The trail led northwest until it reached the western end of the  sandstone cliffs to the north of the fort; there it ran into a  welldefined path which wound northward into a country we had not as  yet

considerable size, constructed in  the middle so that a cord could be easily attached to it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he said at last.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He looked at me with a very questioning eye, and I read hesitation in  his face.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he cried, his eyes starting from his  head.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He thrust a hollow reed into it and cried out with  delight like a schoolboy then he was able, on touching it with a  lighted match, to cause a sharp explosion and a blue flame at the far  end of the tube.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He has gone to fetch some water, said Lord Roxton.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He

the envelope and cut it with his penknife.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he would cry, pointing to the north.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He would tell the history of the

represented.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He spoke little of his own exploits in Brazil  and Peru, but it was a revelation to me to find the excitement which  was caused by his presence

back at me with hard  angry eyes, but I refused to give way.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He wished, he said, to ask Professor Challenger whether  the results to which he had alluded in his remarks had been obtained  during a journey to the headwaters of the Amazon made by him two years  before.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He seemed to have a definite message.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He paused for a moment, and then, raising his  voice, repeated slowly the words:  Which were extinct before the  coming of

private life, still  the vast processes of the universe were not fully justified if they  were to end entirely in his production.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He sat  slowly down, blew out his chest, passed his hand caressingly down his  beard, and looked with drooping eyelids and supercilious eyes at the  crowded hall before him.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He put the pterodactyl into your head.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He  listened with a sceptical smile on his gaunt face, and roared with  laughter on hearing that the Professor had convinced

a card from his desk.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He handed me a lens.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He handed me a photographhalfplate

liberty with him.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"He had a fearful row about it in Vienna, I believe.","nextSentStartsWith":"finally,"},{"sentence":"He had  gone the length of faking some

eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was, to my surprise, no Indian, but a white man; indeed, I  may say a very white man, for he was flaxenhaired and had some  characteristics of an albino.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he repeated.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he cried, leaning forward and dabbing a great hairy  sausage of a finger on to the picture.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He couldnt really have stood in front of that brute and  lived to draw it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was, we will say, over five feet high.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He handed me the open book.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He opened the standard work to which he had already referred

sunshine.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He never existed.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He is not a popular person, the genial Challenger, said he.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was a stern, gaunt man, with a harsh voice, and an  aggressive manner, but he had the merit of knowing how to assimilate  the ideas of other men, and to pass them on in a way which was  intelligible and even interesting to the lay public, with a happy knack  of being funny about the most unlikely objects, so that the precession  of the Equinox or the formation of a vertebrate became a highly  humorous process as treated by him.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He told us of the globe, a huge mass of flaming gas, flaring  through the heavens.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He hesitated, stammered,  repeated himself, got snarled in a long sentence, and finally turned  furiously upon the cause of his troubles.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he cried, glaring across the platform.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He would be obliged if Professor Challenger would  give the latitude and the longitude of the country in which prehistoric  animals were to be found.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He got delirium on Toosday, and has been ragin like a devil  ever

prospect.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He has a gentle voice and a quiet  manner, but behind his twinkling blue eyes there lurks a capacity for  furious wrath and implacable resolution, the more dangerous because  they are held in leash.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He threw back his head, and there he stood in  the golden glow with all his old Assyrian luxuriance of beard, all his  native insolence of drooping eyelids and intolerant eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He added  privately that we were now approaching the door of the unknown country,  and that the fewer whom we took into our confidence the better it would  be.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He is convinced, of  course, that he is destined for Westminster Abbey.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He simply swung his pack upon his  back and continued upon his march.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He had his  Zeiss glasses in his hand.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He grinned  and blinked and bowed until his colleague turned and walked away.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He  was not alone at the time, but there was a friend, an American named  James Colver, who remained in the boat and did not meet this  ecclesiastic.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He had some  presentiment that worthy footsteps would follow close behind him.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He faced us as we assembled for breakfast with a  deprecating false modesty in his eyes, as who should say, I know that  I deserve all that you can say, but I pray you to spare my blushes by  not saying it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he cried, his teeth shining through his beard.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He had approached the bridge when Lord John laid his hand upon his coat.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He clambered up and waved his arms in  the air.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he cried; at last!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He may have had no part in  it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was our one trusty link with the outside world.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He then fastened his end of the rope to the package of  supplies which had been carried up, and we were able to drag it across.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he cried at last.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he whispered.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He laughed  sonorously at his own conceit, for, though he had little sense of  humor, the crudest pleasantry from his own lips moved him always to  roars of appreciation.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was at my very  heels.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was an Indian.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was grabbing at our stores all the time he  spoke.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he panted.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He had the short body, the  big shoulders, the round chest, no neck, a great ruddy frill of a  beard, the tufted eyebrows, the What do you want, damn you!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was begging, pleading, imploring for his comrades  life.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He beamed at us with the old paternal smile, but European science would  have been somewhat amazed could they have seen their chosen child, the  hope of the future, with his tangled, unkempt head, his bare chest, and  his tattered clothes.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He cant stick your appearance,  Challenger; and, by George!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He lay upon his side,  his limbs drawn up, and his head screwed round at a most unnatural  angle, so that he seemed to be looking straight over his own shoulder.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He had faithfully promised to stay where he was, and  we had not a doubt that he would be as good as his word.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He  then looked at us and asked some questions, after which he stepped up  with much dignity and embraced us also each in turn.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He swelled with some secret purpose, but would say no more.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He turned away and I left him wandering on through the wood with his  extraordinary cage around him.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He put one hand in the front of his ragged jacket and pointed proudly  with the other.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he whispered to me, and then louder to Challenger.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He had prepared a sort of  collar of leather with many straps depending from it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He alone  had no desire to hold us against our will in a strange land.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he cried, I believe Ive got it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He pointed up to the caves when he gave it to me, said I.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He and his companions had seen at least a dozen creatures, most of them  at a distance, which corresponded with nothing at present known to  Science.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He  instanced a snake, the cast skin of which, deep purple in color, was  fiftyone feet in length, and mentioned a white creature, supposed to  be mammalian, which gave forth wellmarked phosphorescence in the  darkness; also a large black moth, the bite of which was supposed by  the Indians to be highly poisonous.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He described also the iguanodon and the pterodactyltwo of the first  of the wonders which they had encountered.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He could only say that he would like to see that skull.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He laughed  like an idiot, while I made for the door.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was  a fine man, a fine man.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he cried, and took a step toward her.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He is Baron von Schoenvorts.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He raised his finger to his lips and came closer to me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He had not been sick, and assured me that he was a former  R.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He didnt shoot me the next morning as he had promised, and it has  never been clear to me why he postponed the execution of my sentence.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He licked my face and  rolled over on his back, reaching for me with his big, awkward paws.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He expired  without giving any details.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He didnt die for a halfhour after that; nor did he speak  againaloud; but just a few seconds before he went to meet his Maker,  his lips moved in a faint whisper; and as I leaned closer to catch his  words, what do you suppose I heard?","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was in the tower and watching the  compass, to which he called my attention.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He called it  Caprona and sailed away.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He called down  for a bucket and a rope, and when they were passed up to him, he  lowered the former into the sea and drew it in filled with water.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He looked at  me sheepishly all the time, for he knew that no wellbred dog should  eat at table; but the poor fellow was so wasted from improper food that  I couldnt enjoy my own meal had he been denied an immediate share in  it; and anyway Lys wanted to feed him.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He spent the afternoon  shaping a swaggerstick from the branch of jarrah and talking with Miss  La Rue, who had sufficiently unbent toward him to notice his existence.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He is more tractable now, and we are  going to release him, for he has assured us that he will not permit his  fellows to harm us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He expects  to be gone several weeks and to follow along their base in search of a  point where they may be scaled.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was talking loudly  and gesticulating wildly.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was the first to fall asleep; but I  imagine we must have followed suit soon, for we were both tired.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He looked at me in surprise.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He must have been asleep  in the long grass, for I saw him rise and look about him in a  bewildered way, and then I raised my gun and let him have it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He commanded them to stand back and

the night with them.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He was heavier than I by many pounds, and so weighted by the burden he  carried that I easily overtook him; and at last he turned, snarling, to  face me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He  recognized me, and with a low growl he threw Lys aside and came for me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"He seemed to

perhaps five minutes longer on the deck.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I watched the water rise until the little deck I stood on was awash,  and then I clambered once more to the top of

the bow.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I cursed myself for  my folly in going out upon the deck, and then this thought suggested  anothera hideous one: who was it that had really been

escaped it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was greatly relieved to find that nothing was wrong, for the  girls words had caused me considerable apprehension.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I waited  until half an hour after Benson had gone on duty, and then I went on  deck, passing through the conningtower where Benson sat, and looking  at the compass.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I asked her what she meant,  thinking I could see the influence of von Schoenvorts raising a  suspicion against one of my most trusted men.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I have not  spoken to Baron von Schoenvorts other than in your presence when first  we came aboard the U33.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I cannot tell you, Lys, I replied, but it came to me from two  different sources.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had to watch you, and I had to put you  on your guard against a repetition of your madness.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could not believe it, I said; and yet two of my men reported  having seen you in conversation with von Schoenvorts late at night upon  two separate occasionsafter each of which some great damage was found  done us in the morning.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I can never forgive you.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I want to thank you, I said, for your bravery and loyaltyyou were  magnificent.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could not understand her, and I craved an opportunity  to talk with her again in an effort to fathom her and her intentions,  and so I made it a point to follow her up the ladder.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I suppose the poor  devils never reached land, and if they did, they most probably perished  on that cold and unhospitable shore; but I couldnt permit them aboard  the U33.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I covered him with my revolver, and at the  same instant the torpedo struck the raider, the terrific explosion  drowning the Germans command to his men.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I saw the white wake leap from her bow straight toward the enemy  cruiser.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I signaled back to Olson: Let er  go!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I dropped back below.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I must!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I looked down on her wistfully.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  have given you a chance to do somethingnow do it!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I do not care to hear your thanks  or any other expression from you.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I started; but she shut me up  with a word.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I saw that we had reached the end of our rope.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was surprised  to note that von Schoenvorts often permitted Benson to take command;  but I reconciled this by the fact that Benson appeared to know more of  the duties of a submarine commander than did any of the stupid Germans.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I couldnt imagine how it had happened; but it had.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I gave the master of the Balmen a  receipt for what we took, together with an affidavit signed by Bradley,  Olson, and myself, stating briefly how we had come into possession of  the U33 and the urgency of our need for what we took.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I explained our circumstances to her skipper and asked for food, water  and oil; but when he found that we were not German, he became very  angry and abusive and started to draw away from us; but I was in no  mood for any such business.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I ordered the U33s course altered, and we bore  down upon the stranger, for I had come to a decision which was the  result of necessity.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I questioned both Olson and Benson closely in the matter of the  compass; but each stoutly maintained that no one had tampered with it  during his tour of duty.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I told him to do so; and then I set to work improvising a crude sextant  with which we finally took our bearings in a rough and most  unsatisfactory manner; for when the work was done, we did not know how  far from the truth the result might be.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I went back to Bradley and told him what I had discovered.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was glad that it was he, for I had considerable confidence in his  loyalty, and so it was with a feeling of security that I went below and  lay down.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  started to follow, for even believing what I did, I was sorry that I  had hurt her.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I suddenly asked the girl, determined to  commence a probe of my own along the lines which duty demanded.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I recognized him as Benson, the man who, Wilson had said,  reported having seen Lys with von Schoenvorts two nights before.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I called Bradley and Olson on deck and told them what had happened, but  for the life of me I couldnt bring myself to repeat what Wilson had  reported to me the previous night.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I think that it was this last thought which hurt me  the worst.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I forgot at once the cruel  misgivings of the past night as I set to work to take my observations.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I think Ive  found out whos doin the mischief, he whispered, and nodded his head  toward the girls room.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I knew that the valve had never opened itself.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had given her the commanders room, Bradley and  I taking that of the deckofficer, while Olson and two of our best men  occupied the room ordinarily allotted to petty officers.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had relieved Olson, who  had remained in the tower at my direction, having been a member of one  of the early British submarine crews, and therefore having some  knowledge of the business.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I expected momentarily to  feel the deluge of inrushing water, but none came.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was just preparing to signal her, when a flame flashed  from her bows, and an instant later the water in front of us was thrown  high by the explosion of a shell.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I hated Baron Friedrich von Schoenvorts with such  utter intensity that the emotion thrilled me with a species of  exaltation.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I wondered if in her  heart of hearts she did not love him yet.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I merely inclined my head.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was  assisting the girl down the ladder and still retained a hold upon her  armpossibly after such support was no longer necessarywhen she  turned and looked squarely into the face of the German.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I know more about this particular sub than the  officer who commanded her.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I asked the  girl if she was hurt, but she assured me that she was none the worse  for this second wetting; nor did she seem to suffer any from shock.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I fell  heavily upon him, but was upon my feet in the instant.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had perhaps the fraction of a second longer to live when I heard an  angry growl behind us mingle with a cry of pain and rage from the giant  who carried me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I saw his wild endeavors to  regain his equilibrium; I saw him reel drunkenly for an instant upon  the brink of eternity and then, with a loud scream, slip into the sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I heard someone shriek an order into  the engineroom; the boat shuddered and trembled to the sudden  reversing of the engines, and our speed quickly lessened.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I saw the  depleted guncrew on the submarine fire their piece and I felt the  shock of impact and heard the loud explosion as the shell struck and  exploded in our bows.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I instantly grasped the  brazen effrontery of the plucky English skipperhe was going to ram  five hundreds tons of Uboat in the face of her trained gun.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I wish, though, that we had gone bankrupt,  my father and I, before ever we turned out that Frankenstein of a  thing.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had no  idea you were aa    Nor am I, I replied.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I know her well.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I stood up on a thwart and waved  my soggy coat above my head.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was cold myself, though I had almost  forgotten it until Nobbler moved and I felt a new sensation of cold  along my leg against which he had lain, and suddenly realized that in  that one spot I had been warm.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had managed to bail all the  water out of the boat with cupped hands, ending by mopping the balance  up with my handkerchiefa slow and backbreaking procedure; thus I had  made a comparatively dry place for the girl to lie down low in the  bottom of the boat, where the sides would protect her from the night  wind, and when at last she did so, almost overcome as she was by  weakness and fatigue, I threw my wet coat over her further to thwart  the chill.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I am fond of this dog, she replied.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I wondered how he would take it, for he is as unused to women  as I.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I told her, then, as well as I could, all that I had seenthe  submarine shelling the open boats and all the rest of it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  felt no particular distress until I suddenly started upward at  everincreasing velocity; then my lungs seemed about to burst, and I  must have lost consciousness, for I remember nothing more until I  opened my eyes after listening to a torrent of invective against  Germany and Germans.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I went  down and down and down.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I remember all that happened beforeoh, but I wish  that I might forget it!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I am afraid to die!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I hope that you are feeling better, I finally managed to say.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I have never been a ladies man; at  LelandStanford I was the butt of the class because of my hopeless  imbecility in the presence of a pretty girl; but the men liked me,  nevertheless.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I worked over her for an hour, and at last I was rewarded by a  deep sigh, and again those great eyes opened and looked into mine.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I removed her lifebelt and my soggy  coat and made a pillow for her head.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  had never looked upon such perfect features, such a divine molding  which was at the same time humanintensely human.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  had gotten well over the area of the wreck when not a halfdozen yards  ahead of me a lifeboat shot bow foremost out of the ocean almost its  entire length to flop down upon its keel with a mighty splash.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had sat  in that very conningtower and directed the efforts of the sweating  crew below when first her prow clove the sunny summer waters of the  Pacific; and now this creature of my brain and hand had turned  Frankenstein, bent upon pursuing me to my death.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  knew her to a rivet.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I saw one shell burst in a group of women and  children, and then I turned my head and covered my eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I rose, also, and over the ships side, I saw not two hundred  yards distant the periscope of a submarine, while racing toward the  liner the wake of a torpedo was distinctly visible.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I shall never forget the ashy faces of the passengers as they stampeded  for their lifebelts, though there was no panic.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I am, or was, junior member of my fathers  firm.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I rescued it, but  I was soaked above the

 a happy day there with a spud.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I am a solicitors clerk, said he.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I

mechanically bowing and shaking  hands with a little gingerhaired man who was coiled up in the deep  armchair which had once been sacred to my own use.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I cried, Gladys!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I rushed down the garden path, hammered at the door, heard  the voice of Gladys within, pushed past the staring maid, and strode  into the sittingroom.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I have  hinted also at the trouble which the Professors baggage gave us when  we left the plateau, and had I described our voyage I might have said a  good deal of the worry we had to coax with putrid fish the appetite of  our filthy companion.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I have safely conducted these three gentlemen to the spot  mentioned, and I have, as you have heard, convinced them of the  accuracy of my previous account.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I move, then, that, while Professor Summerlee be thanked for  his interesting address, the whole matter shall be regarded as  nonproven, and shall be referred back to a larger, and possibly more

room.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I wouldnt do that, sir.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I dont suppose  any paper will want to report it, for Waldron has been reported

asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I should say he is about  the besthated man in London.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I dont want to get into a

remember that as I dropped off to sleep my last  recollection was that Challenger was squatting, like a monstrous  bullfrog, by the fire, his huge head in his hands, sunk apparently in  the deepest thought, and entirely oblivious to the goodnight which I  wished him.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I venture to think so.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could not have  accomplished it, nor could Summerlee, if Challenger had not gained the  summit (it was extraordinary to see such activity in so unwieldy a  creature) and there fixed the rope round the trunk of the

turned, and found that he was examining with great interest the tree  to which I clung.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I think he will  be the most useful at this task.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I came next,  and tried hard not to look down into the horrible gulf over which I was  passing.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  have waited and waited, and now has come my chance.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I should have remembered  that these people have long memories for bloodfeuds, and have been  more upon my guard.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I not leave you.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I do  not know that I can bring their appearance home to you better than by  saying that they looked like monstrous kangaroos, twenty feet in  length, and with skins like black crocodiles.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had the same feeling of mystery and danger around us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I felt a  prod at the back of my neck, and turned dizzy with the shock.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I say, Malone, said he, do you remember that place where those  beasts were?","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I should have thought no more of Lord Johns remark were  it not that once again that night I heard him mutter to himself:  Blue  clayclay in a volcanic tube!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I know  no sound to which I could compare this amazing tumult, which seemed to  come from some spot within a few hundred yards of our camp.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I stooped and peered over his shoulder through the gap.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I thought he wouldnt face the fire, said Lord John, laughing, as he  came back and threw his branch among the faggots.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I have already expressed my anticipation that something of  the sort might exist upon this plateau.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was not aware that it was  necessary to ask your permission before smiling at a harmless  pleasantry.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I venture to trust that we may have some future  opportunity for the closer study of the carnivorous dinosaurs.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I have dwelt up to now upon the terrors of Maple White Land; but there  was another side to the subject, for all that morning we wandered among  lovely flowersmostly, as I observed, white or yellow in color, these  being, as our professors explained, the primitive

office of my paper and face  old McArdle, said I.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I confess that as Summerlee stated his view it struck me as altogether  reasonable.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I absolutely refuse to leave,  however, until we have made at least a superficial examination of this  country, and are able to take back with us something in the nature of a  chart.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I caught a glimpse of a hairy body like that of a  reddish pig, and then it was gone amid a swirl of leaves and branches.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was so shocked at the sudden and strange appearance of this apeman  that I hesitated whether I should not climb down again and tell my  experience to my companions.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could see at my very feet the glade of the iguanodons, and  farther off was a round opening in the trees which marked the swamp of  the pterodactyls.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I trust, sir, that my name will have other and more personal claims  upon posterity, said Challenger, severely.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  need no such monument.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I warmed at the thought.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I seemed to hear  her voice as she said it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  may have said somewhere in this chronicle that I am too imaginative to  be a really courageous man, but that I have an overpowering fear of  seeming afraid.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  simply could not slink back with nothing done.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I thought of the despairing yell of  the tortured iguanodonthat dreadful cry which had echoed through the  woods.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I stopped, and,  picking a cartridge from my pocket, I opened the breech of my gun.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could notmust notfail.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I passed  close to the pterodactyl swamp, and as I did so, with a dry, crisp,  leathery rattle of wings, one of these great creaturesit was twenty  feet at least from tip to tiprose up from somewhere near me and  soared into the air.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I crouched low  among the bushes, for I knew from past experience that with a single  cry the creature could bring a hundred of its loathsome mates about my  ears.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had no time to examine it further for I had need  to hurry if I were to be back in camp in the morning.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could testify  that it was full of strange creatures, and I had seen several land  forms of primeval life which we had not before encountered.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was plodding up the slope, turning these thoughts over in my mind,  and had reached a point which may have been halfway to home, when my  mind was brought back to my own position by a strange noise behind me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I stood like a man paralyzed, still staring at the ground which I had  traversed.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I say hopped advisedly, for the beast moved like a  kangaroo, springing along in an erect position upon its powerful hind  legs, while its front ones were held bent in front of it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  began to walk slowly round, therefore, feeling in every direction to  find out what this strange place could be into which I had been so  opportunely precipitated.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I remembered that Challenger had declared that man could  not exist upon the plateau, since with his feeble weapons he could not  hold his own against the monsters who roamed over it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I took heart, however, as I recalled a conversation  between Challenger and Summerlee upon the habits of the great saurians.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  clambered to the edge of the pit and looked over.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could see or hear nothing of my enemy.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I raised my voice in a cheery shout to allay  their fears.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was so stunned by this sudden shock that for a time I must have  nearly lost my reason.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could have  torn my hair and beaten my head in my despair.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was not absolutely alone in the world.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  went to the edge of the plateau and looked over.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  make fast to this stump, and so you have bridge.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had two completed letters already waiting.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I also drew up a note, to be given to any white merchant or  captain of a steamboat whom the Indian could find, imploring them to  see that ropes were sent to us, since our lives must depend upon it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I got down, therefore, and pondered over what I should do.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had left him calm in his bearing,  correct in his person, prim in his dress.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I have the other two.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I asked, when I had got my breath.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I shot one of them through the belly, but before we knew where  we were they had us spreadeagled on our backs.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I think he had gone a bit off his  head at the suddenness of it, for he raged and cursed at them like a  lunatic.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I thought it was the end of us, but instead of that it started them on  a new line.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I couldnt have believed it if I  hadnt seen it with my own eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I think  they have cleared, dont you?","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I expect theres heaps of skeletons there, if we looked for  em.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I cried, in consternation.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I couldnt bring em with  me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I dont think they  would touch Challenger, but I wouldnt answer for Summerlee.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I have tried to imitate here Lord Roxtons jerky talk, his short,  strong sentences, the halfhumorous, halfreckless tone that ran  through it all.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I hope to the Lord we are not too late  already!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I do not hesitate to say that the  disappearance of Professor Summerlee and myself would have left an  appreciable gap in modern zoological history.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I beg, sir, that you will change the subject.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I am only here as a Press reporter, I answered.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I will keep well within the truth.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I leave the matter to your discretion.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I picked up my rifle and  strolled in the direction of the brook, leaving my friends to lay out  the scanty breakfast.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had not yet learned  their cunning or their strength.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was making my  way through this at a point which was just out of sight of my  companions, when, under one of the trees, I noticed something red  huddled among the bushes.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was lifted lightly from the ground, and I  felt an intolerable pressure forcing my head back and back until the  strain upon the cervical spine was more than I could bear.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could struggle no longer.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I awoke to find myself on my back upon the grass in our lair within the  thicket.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I missed the beast in my flurry, but he dropped you  all right and was off like a streak.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I wish I had fifty  men with rifles.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I will assuredly cooperate.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  should say beyond doubt that it contained a considerable proportion of  free hydrogen.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I hold you to your word, Challenger.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I will tell also of the huge bird which chased Challenger to the  shelter of the rocks one daya great running bird, far taller than an  ostrich, with a vulturelike neck and cruel head which made it a  walking death.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had one strange experience as I came from this second visit which had  involved my being away for a night from my companions.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I may say that he seemed to possess an extraordinary  fascination for the Indian women, and that he always carried a large  spreading palm branch with which he beat them off as if they were  flies, when their attentions became too pressing.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I mean, my dear Summerlee, to give you such a demonstration of its  powers that after seeing it you will, I am sure, have no hesitation in  trusting yourself to it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was, I will  admit, somewhat baffled by the difficulty of discovering an envelope to  contain the gas, but the contemplation of the immense entrails of these  reptiles supplied me with a solution to the problem.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I will  now show you its capacity in that direction.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had just time to throw my arms round his ascending  waist when I was myself whipped up into the air.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could read that on his face as he gave it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I suggested.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I looked at the mark to which his finger pointed, and I gave a sudden  cry of joy.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I hurried back along the way we had come, my torch in my hand.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I admit that the paper was exuberant in  the matter, out of compliment to its own enterprise in sending a  correspondent, but the other great dailies were hardly less full in  their account.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  have heard tonight similar, but even more offensive, sentiments from  the person who has just sat down, and though it is a conscious effort  of selfeffacement to come down to that persons mental level, I will  endeavor to do so, in order to allay any reasonable doubt which could  possibly exist in the minds of anyone.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I can exhibit to you from  my portfolio a picture of that creature taken from life which would  convince you    DR.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was carried ashore, and  while the evening meal was being prepared, I wandered to and fro along  the rocky, shattered shore.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I know a sub as a mother knows her babys face, and  have commanded a score of them on their trial runs.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I graduated under Curtiss, and  after a long siege with my father obtained his permission to try for  the Lafayette Escadrille.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was sitting on deck with some of the fellows who were going into the  American ambulance service with me, my Airedale, Crown Prince Nobbler,  asleep at my feet, when the first blast of the whistle shattered the  peace and security of the ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I stood rigid, spellbound, watching the white wake of the torpedo.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I had superintended her construction.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I stooped and stroked his head.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I cried, and running to the side of the ship, dived  headforemost over the rail.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I glanced hurriedly about for something to  which to cling.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I say beneficent circumstance  even in the face of the fact that a fate far more hideous confronts us  than that which we escaped that day; for because of that circumstance I  have met her whom otherwise I never should have known; I have met and  loved her.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I felt something rise in my throat as I looked  down upon that radiant vision, and I swore that I should live to avenge  her murder.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  leaned over the boats side and drew her quickly in to the comparative  safety which God had given me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I chafed her hands and arms and  feet.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was rubbing one of her hands when she opened her eyes,  and I dropped it as though it were a redhot rivet.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I thought I must be  dead, and I was afraid to look, for fear that I should see nothing but  blackness about me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I thought I should never cease to sink.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I have always admired Nobs; but this  was the first time that it had ever occurred to me that I might wish to  be Nobs.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I thanked God for that.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I helped design her and took  her out on her first run.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I thought you were an American, she said.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I did not  have to look at it to know that it was a heavy pistol.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I could  scarce repress a cheer.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I hastily pushed the girl down the companionway leading to the  engineroom, and then I raised my pistol and fired my first shot at a  boche.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I saw the helmsman lunge  forward upon the wheel, pulling the helm around so that the tug sheered  off quickly from her course, and I recall realizing that all our  efforts were to be in vain, because of all the men aboard, Fate had  decreed that this one should fall first to an enemy bullet.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I saw and realized these things even as I was leaping into the  pilothouse and grasping the wheel, standing astride the dead body of  the helmsman.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I sprang from the  pilothouse and followed, not to be left out in the cold when it came  to strafing the boches.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I shall never forget the hideous expression upon the face of  the great Prussian with whom chance confronted me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I reached far over to seize her hand.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  was to learn for myself that this slender and seemingly delicate  creature possessed the heart and courage of a warrior.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I guess youre right, he admitted.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I do, I assured him.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I then ordered  all hands below except one man who was to act as lookout.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I believe that they were relieved at the prospect of being detained at  a comfortable English prisoncamp for the duration of the war after the  perils and privations through which they had passed.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I altered the course of the submarine and set off in chase;  but the steamer was faster than we, and soon left us hopelessly astern.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I passed Nobs down to him, and following, saw  to the closing and fastening of the hatch.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I almost smiled.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I made Nobs  bed down in Lys room, for I knew she would feel less alone.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was on deck at  the time and noted the gradual list.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I seen her sneakin from the crews room

me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I cant make it out, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I  motioned him on deck and then called him to one side, asking if he had  seen anything out of the way or unusual during his trick on watch the  night before.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I took  advantage of the absence of the men upon the deck to go below for my  breakfast, which the cook was already preparing upon the electric  stove.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I am a splendid sleeper.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I watched her face carefully as I spoke, and I thought that I detected  a very faint flush mounting her cheek.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I do, she replied, and  turning her back upon me, she walked quickly toward her room.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I reached the door to the crews room just behind her  and in time to see von Schoenvorts lean forward and whisper something  to her as she passed; but she must have guessed that she might be  watched, for she passed on.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I slept twelve hours straight, and when I awoke and discovered what I  had done, I lost no time in getting to the conning

sun.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"I was the last to come, and  when I reached the bottom, I found myself looking into the muzzle of a  pistol in the hands of Baron Friedrich von

us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  took a long time to build that wall, and we all turned in and helped  except von Schoenvorts, who, by the way, had not spoken to me except in  the line of official business since our encountera condition of armed  neutrality which suited me to a T.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was the first  time that she had spoken thus to me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is full, it is satisfying, it is  ennobling.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It couldnt have hurt him, for it didnt leave a mark; but  he flew into a terrific rage, shouting: Attention!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It consisted  of upward of five hundred individuals representing several species  closely allied to man.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was grazing away from us and had not  seen us when one of my men called my attention to it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was further understood that we were to act as a military  organization under military rules and disciplineI as commander, with  Bradley as my first lieutenant and Olson as my second, in command of  the Englishmen; while von Schoenvorts was to act as an additional  second lieutenant and have charge of his own men.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was more the heat of a steamroom than of an  oven.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It seemed strange that beyond  the buttressed walls of Caprona icebergs floated and the south wind was  biting, for only a gentle breeze moved across the face of these living  waters, and that was damp and warm.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was some time  before we could persuade the girl to continue her meal, but at last  Bradley prevailed upon her, pointing out that we had come upstream  nearly forty miles since the boche had been seized, and that during  that time we had seen literally thousands of these denizens of the  river, indicating that the chances were very remote that this was the  same Plesiosaur.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It gave one a feeling of newness that was  almost embarrassing, although it didnt seem to embarrass our  appetites.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It had been weeks, now,  since we had tasted it, and the sight of the reptiles gave me an  ideathat a steak or two from one of them might not be bad eating.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It charged us as savagely as a mad bull, and one would have  thought it intended to destroy and devour the mighty Uboat, as I  verily believe it did intend.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It turned its eyes upon us,  opened its lizardlike mouth, emitted a shrill hiss and came for us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is fair to assume that inland  the river is fed by pure streams, that there are fruits and herbs and  game.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It flows through a land covered with  vegetationand therefore a land upon which the sun shines.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  cant come from the ocean; so it must come from the land.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It must  have been about two bells of the afternoon watch that Bradley called my  attention to the branch of a tree, with leaves upon it, floating on the  sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was the body of  a low type of man or a high type of beast.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a long slim blade he offeredone that I could carry between my  teethand so I accepted it gladly.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was she who closed  the divingtank seacocks and roused Olson and me, and had the pumps  started to empty them.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It did not take me long to liberate myself, and then I  was at her side.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  turned out to be quite the most exciting adventure I had ever  encountered.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was daylight when I awoke.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was another two days before we were ready to limp along, half  repaired.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was wide open.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It seemed to me that the divingtanks never had filled so slowly.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It proved itself such that morning, for I had scarce  gotten into my dry clothes and taken the girls apparel to the  captains cabin when an order was shouted down into the engineroom for  full speed ahead, and an instant later I heard the dull boom of a gun.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It had  never been there before; now it will never cease to be there.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It made me jealous.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It did not take me long to clamber over its side and drag Nobs in to  comparative safety, and then I glanced around upon the scene of death  and desolation which surrounded us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It lasted for perhaps two seconds, to be  followed by the screams and moans of the wounded, the cursing of the  men and the hoarse commands of the ships officers.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  struck us on the starboard side almost amidships.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was strange under  these altered surroundings to see the old, wellknown faces and  figures.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It would have made all clear.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  would have been hard to let them down if it had been wished, so dense  was the crowd around them.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It had sprung from the perch and was circling slowly round the  Queens Hall with a dry, leathery flapping of its tenfoot wings, while  a putrid and insidious odor pervaded the room.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was the devil of our  childhood in person.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was understood that Lord John Roxton claimed to have the skull of a  phororachus.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was clear, from  the moment of his rising, that he had a number of friends and  sympathizers in the hall, though they formed a minority in the  audience.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It had been hoped that the proceedings would end there, and that a  vote of thanks and congratulation, moved by Professor Sergius, of  Upsala University, would be duly seconded and carried; but it was soon  evident that the course of events was not destined to flow so smoothly.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was not, however, until he sketched the mysteries of the central  lake that the full interest and enthusiasm of the audience were  aroused.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was for the second evening after our arrival that the great meeting  had been fixed.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was agreed  among us, however, that no definite statement should be given to the  Press until we had met the members of the Zoological Institute, since  as delegates it was our clear duty to give our first report to the body  from which we had received our commission of investigation.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It seemed a poor return for all the courtesy which we  encountered that we should deceive our hosts and benefactors, but under  the circumstances we had really no alternative, and I hereby tell them  that they will only waste their time and their money if they attempt to  follow upon our traces.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was no  wonder that from below we had not observed the place, as the cliffs  curved overhead and an ascent at the spot would have seemed so  impossible as to discourage close inspection.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a small rift, not larger than a  window, but it was enough for all our purposes.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was as I had said.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was, and had  always been, a culdesac.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  was not the result of any convulsion, as in the case of the ascending  tunnel.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was, as I had said, empty, save for a great  number of enormous bats, which flapped round our heads as we advanced  into it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is placed to mark one that is much deeper than the others.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was over a hundred feet long,  and though it was thin it was very strong.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  was Summerlee who first broke the silence.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was on the third day after our forming our camp near the Indian  caves that the tragedy occurred.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is the voice of sanity!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was as Challenger  had said, and the reign of man was assured forever in Maple White Land.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It needed a robust faith in the end to justify such tragic means.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a  valiant move but a foolish one, for the great bandylegged creatures  were slow of foot, while their opponents were as active as cats.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a host of  the stone age that we were accompanying to battlewe with the last  word of the gunsmiths art from St.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was too late to advance that night, so the  Indians settled down into a rude bivouac.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was clear that the natives had come out upon the warpath, for every  man carried his speara long bamboo tipped with bonehis bow and  arrows, and some sort of club or stone battleaxe slung at his side.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was in the early afternoon that we started upon our journey.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was  really shock, rather than any injury, which had prostrated me, and in  halfanhour, in spite of aching head and stiff neck, I was sitting up  and ready for anything.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It may seem to you rash that even for so short a  distance I should quit the shelter of our friendly thicket, but you  will remember that we were many miles from Apetown, that so far as we  knew the creatures had not discovered our retreat, and that in any case  with a rifle in my hands I had no fear of them.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It cant be more than  a couple of hundred yards.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"it was a good bit of work!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It seems that the humans  hold one side of this plateauover yonder, where you saw the  cavesand the apemen hold this side, and there is bloody war between  them all the time.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It will be their first idea.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was heand yet it was not he.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is true  that we had made a strict resolution against firing, but if it seemed  to them that I might be in danger they would not hesitate.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a trapmade by the hand of man.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was so high that I could not reach the top of it  with my hand, and it appeared to be covered with grease.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was, as I have said, a pit, with sharplysloping walls and a level  bottom about twenty feet across.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was of  enormous size and power, like an erect elephant, but its movements, in  spite of its bulk, were exceedingly alert.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was something between a snore and a growl, low, deep, and  exceedingly menacing.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was  shallow, for in many places I saw low sandbanks protruding above the  water.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was out of the question for the  moment, and yet surely we could not leave the plateau until we had some  definite knowledge upon the point.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was wonderful, and yet  it must surely be.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a fearsome walk, and one which will be with me so long as memory  holds.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was like a  boiling kettle or the bubbling of some great pot.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was not until it had settled again that I dared to steal  onwards upon my journey.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a cheery  companion, gurgling and chuckling as it ran, like the dear old  troutstream in the West Country where I have fished at night in my  boyhood.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was dreadful in the forest.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is nothing of the sort, said Summerlee, abruptly.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is clear, however, that he  exists in this country, and that he is not the hairy, gorillalike  variety, which is never seen out of Africa or the East.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was long, whitish, and blotched with pimples, the nose  flattened, and the lower jaw projecting, with a bristle of coarse  whiskers round the chin.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  is clear that it is all thickly wooded, and it would take months to  penetrate it and to learn the relations of one part to another.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was not until he had received his apology that our touchy friend  would suffer himself to be appeased.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was no higher than a horse, but the dim outline suggested  vast bulk and strength.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It stole slowly round the camp, and then  halted near our gateway.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was surely well for man that he came late in the order of  creation.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  was close to  usnot farther than the glade.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was as  earsplitting as any whistle of a railwayengine; but whereas the  whistle is a clear, mechanical, sharpedged sound, this was far deeper  in volume and vibrant with the uttermost strain of agony and horror.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a bluish soil.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a weird  place in itself, but its occupants made it seem like a scene from the  Seven Circles of Dante.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was destined that on this very morningour first in the new  countrywe were to find out what strange hazards lay around us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is a creature walking erect upon threetoed feet, and  occasionally putting one of its fivefingered forepaws upon the ground.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is Maple White Land.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It can only have one name, said he.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is not likely that the sound could have traveled far into  the plateau.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was midday before we had made ourselves secure, but the heat was not  oppressive, and the general character of the plateau, both in its  temperature and in its vegetation, was almost temperate.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It pains me to hear you speak of it in so  unappreciative a fashion.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was evening when he at last climbed down, with a final assurance  that he would keep the Indians till next morning.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was not thicker  than a clothesline, but it was of great strength, and though we could  not make a bridge of it, we might well find it invaluable if we had any  climbing to do.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a fact that our Indians had shown in many ways of late that they  were weary of their journey and anxious to return.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was at such a moment that I learned the stuff of which my three  comrades were composed.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It balanced itself, however, a few  inches from the edge, and there was our bridge to the unknown.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It had already a  strong, natural tilt in the direction of the plateau, so that the  matter was not difficult.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was certainly a brilliant idea.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was Summerlee who  was the first to speak.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was pleasant to see the convolvulus, the  passionflower, and the begonia, all reminding me of home, here among  these inhospitable rocks.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was evident that the obstacle was far beyond  any efforts which we could make to remove it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was of such a size that a single  man could just fit through by stooping.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a solemn place, for the walls were so gigantic and the slit of  blue sky so narrow and so obscured by a double fringe of verdure, that  only a dim and shadowy light penetrated to the bottom.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was at a point where the face of the cliff was for  the first time split into a narrow cleft.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  is a fastgrowing plant, but it is surely inconceivable that this body  could have been here while the canes grew to be twenty feet in length.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It must be Maple Whites.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was on that, said Professor Challenger, pointing to this tree,  that the pterodactyl was perched.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It may be that we are  condemned to spend our whole lives in this strange, inaccessible place.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a fitting avenue  to a land of wonders.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was in the early forenoon of the next day that we made the great  departure.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is decreed by a merciful Nature that  the human brain cannot think of two things simultaneously, so that if  it be steeped in curiosity as to science it has no room for merely  personal considerations.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was the only sign of earth life which I saw in this great  Amazonian forest.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It struck  me as preposterous in London, but Im bound to say that it seems even  more so upon closer acquaintance.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was at Para also that we engaged Gomez and Manuel, two halfbreeds  from up the river, just come down with a cargo of redwood.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is a wet, foggy morning in the late spring; a  thin, cold rain is falling.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a rather desperate business to come suddenly into ones days  work.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is my friend Professor  Challenger, and amid laughter he renewed his lecture as if this was a  final explanation and no more need be said.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a birdseye view of creation, as interpreted by science, which,  in language always clear and sometimes picturesque, he unfolded before  us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is  not my nature, sir, to cringe to any man, or to seek to prove a fact if  my word has been doubted.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is colossal.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It may interest you  to know that I succeeded in shooting that particular specimen.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It appears to have a considerable beak.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a nearer view of the same scene, though the photograph was  extremely defective.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was the wild dream of an opium smoker, a vision of delirium.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is unique.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is a name to which I am prepared always to lift  my hat.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was  evident that she had seen my exit, but had not observed my return.","nextSentStartsWith":"she"},{"sentence":"It was lucky that I had  opened the door, or we should have gone through it.","nextSentStartsWith":"when"},{"sentence":"It proves, he roared, with a sudden blast of fury, that you are the  damnedest imposter in Londona vile, crawling journalist, who has no  more science than he has decency in his composition!","nextSentStartsWith":"then"},{"sentence":"It  had seemed simple enough at a distance.","nextSentStartsWith":"instantly"},{"sentence":"It was his  size which took ones breath awayhis size and his imposing presence.","nextSentStartsWith":"you"},{"sentence":"It is most considerate of you, madam.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"It was nearly halfpast ten before I had received my message, but a  taxicab took me round in good time for my appointment.","nextSentStartsWith":"said"},{"sentence":"It was the man of all others whom I should  have chosenTarp Henry, of the staff of Nature, a thin, dry, leathery  creature, who was full, to those who knew him, of kindly humanity.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is all in the way of business, sir, I answered.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"It is never a man that I  should love, but always the glories he had won; for they would be  reflected upon me.","nextSentStartsWith":"apparently"},{"sentence":"It was my turn to jump out of my chair.","nextSentStartsWith":"but"},{"sentence":"It is such a pity!","nextSentStartsWith":"heavens!"},{"sentence":"It is no compliment to a man.","nextSentStartsWith":"got"},{"sentence":"IT WAS DREADFUL IN THE FOREST

women like you who brace men up.","nextSentStartsWith":"shortman,"},{"sentence":"It was just after eleven, and the big room was  fairly full, though the rush had not yet set in.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"It was a discreditable business.","nextSentStartsWith":"now,"},{"sentence":"It is certainly rather deep for a layman.","nextSentStartsWith":"but"},{"sentence":"It took some doing, but I flatter myself that it wasnt such a bad job  when it was finished.","nextSentStartsWith":"really,"},{"sentence":"It was an  imposing porticoed house at which we stopped, and the heavilycurtained  windows gave every indication of wealth upon the part of this  formidable Professor.","nextSentStartsWith":"how"},{"sentence":"It was  the most rational remark which I had heard in Enmore Park.","nextSentStartsWith":"on"},{"sentence":"It was at  least seven feet high, and so thin that she could hardly balance upon  it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is very hard, said I.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was my business  to visit this littleknown backcountry and to examine its fauna, which  furnished me with the materials for several chapters for that great and  monumental work upon zoology which will be my lifes justification.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is not too much to say that it will rank level with my own  when the final credit of this business comes to be apportioned.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was this sketchbook, which  was as dilapidated then as you see it now.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a fullpage sketch of a  landscape roughly tinted in colorthe kind of painting which an  openair artist takes as a guide to a future more elaborate effort.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is no doubt a curious formation, said I but I am not geologist  enough to say that it is wonderful.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is incredible.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is monstrousgrotesque.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It struck me that  the man was small, said I.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It would be likely  to recur to a man in a delirium.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was  about six inches long, and thicker than my thumb, with some indications  of dried cartilage at one end of it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It might be a very thick human collarbone, I said.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It belongs to a very large, a very  strong, and, by all analogy, a very fierce animal which exists upon the  face of the earth, but has not yet come under the notice of science.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was the same  direction from which the American had come.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was my business to find out what it was.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a dull gray  landscape, and as I gradually deciphered the details of it I realized  that it represented a long and enormously high line of cliffs exactly  like an immense cataract seen in the distance, with a sloping,  treeclad plain in the foreground.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is the same place, the Professor answered.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is not a pelican, nor, indeed, is it a bird.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was  the only absolute proof of my experiences which I was able to bring  away with me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was unfortunately lost with so much else in the same  boat accident which ruined my photographs.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was at least two feet in length, a curved  bone, with a membranous veil beneath it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was all so unthinkable.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was the wet season, Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It appeared to  be very large; neither to east nor to west could I see any end to the  vista of greencapped cliffs.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is a natural protection to this  singular country.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It will be a comfort to  me to know that I have one ally in the hall, however inefficient and  ignorant of the subject he may be.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was hardly conceivable.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is upon the permanence of  certain types of animal life upon the earth.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is not worth it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is only  right, however, since Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is thus that the great crisis of a mans life springs out at him.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was only the need of getting in the  account of my meeting which drew me at last from his company.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was very clear to me that if dangers  lay before us I could not in all England have found a cooler head or a  braver spirit with which to share them.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was agreed  that I should write home full accounts of my adventures in the shape of  successive letters to McArdle, and that these should either be edited  for the Gazette as they arrived, or held back to be published later,  according to the wishes of Professor Challenger, since we could not yet  know what conditions he might attach to those directions which should  guide us to the unknown land.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is  Professor Challenger, who had promised to see us off.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is all part and parcel of the same system of  quackery and nonsense, for which I regret to say that the writer is  notorious.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a blank sheet.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is an open admission, he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It floods the banks, extends in  great lagoons over a monstrous waste of country, and forms a huge  district, called locally the Gapo, which is for the most part too  marshy for foottravel and too shallow for boating.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It narrowed rapidly, however,  and after two more days steaming we reached an Indian village, where  the Professor insisted that we should land, and that the Esmeralda  should be sent back to Manaos.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is for this reason that I am compelled to be  vague in my narrative, and I would warn my readers that in any map or  diagram which I may give the relation of places to each other may be  correct, but the points of the compass are carefully confused, so that  in no way can it be taken as an actual guide to the country.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was August 2nd when we snapped our last link with the outer world by  bidding farewell to the Esmeralda.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It must be admitted that  Challenger is provocative in the last degree, but Summerlee has an acid  tongue, which makes matters worse.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is surely an Assai palm, said Summerlee.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was an Assai palm which I took for my landmark.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was indeed a wonderful place.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  may have been twenty yards across, and was banked in on each side by  most luxuriant vegetation.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It took us a long day, traveling from seven  in the morning till eight at night, with only two breaks of one hour  each, to get through this obstacle.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was here, while we crossed the  first of these hills, that an incident occurred which may or may not  have been important.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a stork, if ever I saw one.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It stands alone, for we saw nothing more which  could be called remarkable.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is only when I look upon the untroubled faces of my comrades that I  see some glimmer through the darkness.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is like a broad red church  spire, the top of it being level with the plateau, but a great chasm  gaping between.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is certain that there is a point where an ascent is  possible.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It wavered and  quivered above us for a minute, the morning sun gleaming upon its  sleek, sinuous coils.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was the site of an old  encampment, with several empty Chicago meat tins, a bottle labeled  Brandy, a broken tinopener, and a quantity of other travelers  debris.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was not more than forty feet across at the mouth, but it rapidly  closed until it ended in an acute angle, too straight and smooth for an  ascent.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was the  narrowest escape for one or all of us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was handsomely said, and the two men for the first time shook hands.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was worth a stolen supper to

the debate.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is a waste of energy to do anything else, growled Summerlee from  behind his pipe.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was at that

Professors chair.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was malicious, horrible,  with two small red eyes as bright as points of burning coal.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was the shock of my life.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It is quite clear, said I.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was after supper, in his own sanctumthe room of the pink

head.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was then that one of the men stuck his head up through the hatchway  and seeing me, asked permission to come on deck and get a breath of  fresh air.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It seemed  remarkable that we could cross the Atlantic almost to the coast of the  American continent without glimpsing smoke or sail, and at last I

about  right.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was not  the chill of wet clothing, or the dashing spray which drenched my face;  no, it was the chill of the hand of death upon my

miles.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was a  narrow strip of sand at the base of a part of the cliff that seemed  lower than any we had before

surf.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It may have been carried down to the ocean by a river, he  suggested.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It must be  at least 70 or 80

seemed odd to be eating a creature  that should, by all the laws of paleontology, have been extinct for  several million years.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was  the first stream we had found since leaving the river, and I at once  made preparations to test its water.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It looks to me, Whitely, like an error, I said; some assistant god

mastication.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It fills such a  longing in the human breast.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It took us three weeks to build all the houses, which we  constructed close by a cold spring some two miles from the harbor.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was in the form of a square, with bastions  and towers at each corner which would

harbor was in view, and  still we could not see the lake because of the sandstone cliffs which  intervened.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It  was now quite dark, and as I crept around the edge of the cliff, I saw  at a little distance a great fire around which were many  figuresapparently human figures.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"It was Lys, and she was  alive and

their  burrows to watch us, while above us the boughs of the bushes were heavy  with luscious fruit, and below us strange and lovely flowers peeped at  us from among the herbage; or those long moonlit

goodbye in this, our last  message to the world beyond the barrier cliffs.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"}],"we":[{"sentence":"We had to go quite a bit farther than usual before we could surround a  little bunch of antelope, and as I was helping drive them, I saw a fine  red deer a couple of hundred yards behind me.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We all come from there, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We will take a cave high up.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We must find a cave.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We ran as fast as we could around the lower end of the  harbor, scrambled up the cliffs and at last stood upon their summit in  full view of the lake.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We all looked up as the noise approached apparently just  above us, and a moment later there followed a terrific explosion which  hurled us to the ground.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We descended to the compound, and I walked with Lys to the  door of her quarters.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We went up the coast some ten or twelve miles in the U33, tying up to  shore near the mouth of a small stream which emptied great volumes of  crude oil into the seaI find it difficult to call this great lake by  any other name.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are all elated to the seventh heaven of bliss.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have  been living upon the fat of the land, Ahm having shown us the edible  fruits, tubers and herbs, and twice a week we go out after fresh meat.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We changed our plans a trifle when it came to building the palisade,  for we found a rotted cliff near by where we could get all the flat  buildingstone we needed, and so we constructed a stone wall entirely  around the buildings.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We saw nothing of the wild men of the previous day, and only once were  we menaced by any of the strange denizens of Caprona, when some  frightful nightmare of the sky swooped down upon us, only to be driven  off by a fusillade of bullets.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We decided to take  him with us to camp, and by means of belts we managed to secure his  hands behind his back and place a leash around his neck before he  regained consciousness.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were about a quarter of a mile from the rest of our party, and in  full sight of them as they lay in the tall grass watching us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We got within a hundred yards of  the deer when he suddenly raised his antlered head and pricked up his  great ears.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We followed the stream upward through a beautiful country  for about five miles, and then came upon its source in a little  boulderstrewn clearing.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We ran along beside them for a matter of ten miles, arriving off a  broad cleft which led into what appeared to be another lake.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We found the lake deep and the bottom rocky and  steeply shelving toward the center, and once when I moved straight out  from shore to take other soundings we could find no bottom whatsoever.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had an easy time getting  awayas we learned later, because the saurians do not commence to feed  until late in the morning.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We also dipped  up some of the river water and found it, though quite warm, a little  sweeter than before.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We proceeded up the river for some forty miles before darkness overtook  us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We looked in the direction he pointed and saw  a long, glossy neck surmounted by a small head rising above the surface  of the river.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were in the middle of a broad and now sluggish

had advanced a hundred yards, perhaps, when our first  danger confronted us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We submerged very slowly and without  headway more than sufficient to keep her nose in the right direction,  and as we went down, I saw outlined ahead of us the black opening in  the great cliff.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have the  means for navigating a subterranean river.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We havent one chance for life in a  hundred thousand if we dont find food and water upon Caprona.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were already rather close in; but I ordered the U33s prow turned  inshore and we crept slowly along, constantly dipping up the water and  tasting it to assure ourselves that we didnt get outside the  freshwater current.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We cant afford to give up heart now, when we need heart most.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were now thirstier than ever.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We will find it, Bradley, for we must find it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We took our bearings with our crude and inaccurate instruments; we  searched the chart; we cudgeled our brains; and at last it was Bradley  who suggested a solution.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We opened a new tank.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We thought he was crazy; but he wasnt, for that afternoon we sighted a  great berg south of us, and wed been running north, we thought, for  days.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We reckoned, or rather guessed, that we were somewhere off  the coast of Peru.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were all asleep.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were sailing due west.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We moved in quite close to her.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were all pretty well done up  and looked forward to the time when we could go on deck and fill our  lungs with fresh air.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We will meet even a worse reception if we  go nosing around a British portmines, nets and all of it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We hoisted the Union Jack and remained on deck, asking Bradley to go  below and assign to each member of the crew his duty, placing one  Englishman with a pistol beside each German.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were within fifty feet of them when they awakened to the intentional  menace of our maneuver.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were thirsty, hungry, uncomfortable, and cold.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were caught in the suction  only enough to be drawn backward a few yards, neither of us being  carried beneath the surface.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were  thrown to the decks, bruised and stunned, and then above the ship,  carrying with it fragments of steel and wood and dismembered human  bodies, rose a column of water hundreds of feet into the air.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were entirely  defenseless; yet without warning, we were being torpedoed.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have a story of a flight and a descent by ropes which precluded the  production of larger specimens.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We turned and  plunged into the cave which led to home.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are  through!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We turned into it to find that we  were in a much larger passage than before.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We  hurried eagerly along it until, with a deep groan of bitter  disappointment, we were brought to a halt.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have descended in safety, though in a most unexpected fashion, and  all is well with us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have satisfied ourselves that we cannot climb down and that  there is no tunnel.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We now stood  amazed at the sight, for their blotched and warty skins were of a  curious fishlike iridescence, and the sunlight struck them with an  evervarying rainbow bloom as they moved.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had both seized  our magazine rifles and ran out to see what the danger could be.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We kept our independence, therefore,  and had our weapons ready for any emergency, while preserving the most  friendly relations.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had returned across the plateau with our allies two days after the  battle, and made our camp at the foot of their cliffs.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are held here with no clear means of making our escape, and  bitterly we chafe against it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have  had adventures enough and they are neither suitable to our character or  our position.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had not long to wait for our enemy.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are blessed, my dear  Challenger, above all zoologists since the world began!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had, it is true, been only a week or so upon the top of  the plateau, but all our spare clothing was in our camp below, and the  one week had been a severe one upon us all, though least to me who had  not to endure the handling of the apemen.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We saw no sign of pursuit, however, and soon we had got  into more open country and beyond their power.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had not so much to fear from  them during the day, but they would be very likely to rush us by night;  so the sooner we got away from their neighborhood the better.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were able now to take a more leisurely view of the Indians whom we  had rescued.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We all awoke exhausted after the terrific emotions and scanty food of  yesterday.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had hardly closed the  thornbush door of our zareba, clasped each others hands, and thrown  ourselves panting upon the ground beside our spring, when we heard a  patter of feet and then a gentle, plaintive crying from outside our  entrance.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We ran forward into the open to meet our friends, and pressed a loaded  rifle into the hands of each.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We slunk  through the bushes in silence until we came to the very edge of the  cliff, close to the old camp.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We filled in the time by opening one of our food tins and making sure  of our breakfast.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were  rising from our brushwood hidingplace when suddenly I felt his grip  upon my arm.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were all fascinated to see them take the dive,  even when we thought it would be our turn next on the springboard.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We listened intently, but nothing save the calling of the birds broke  the deep peace of the forest.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have thought of that.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have to bear in mind, remarked Summerlee, that there are many  prehistoric forms which have never come down to us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We  were all sleeping round our dying fire when we were arousedor,  rather, I should say, shot out of our slumbersby a succession of the  most frightful cries and screams to which I have ever listened.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We should not be here if you hadnt, said I, with conviction.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are  exceptionally well informed, Summerlee, as to the habits of the enraged  pterodactyl.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We staggered through the brushwood, and even as we reached the trees  the harpies were on us again.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We passed very slowly through the woods, partly because Lord Roxton  acted as scout before he would let us advance, and partly because at  every second step one or other of our professors would fall, with a cry  of wonder, before some flower or insect which presented him with a new  type.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We saw the shimmering slaty gleam of their skins  between the treetrunks, and their heads undulating high above the  brushwood.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We therefore blocked the entrance to our zareba by filling it up with  several thorny bushes, and left our camp with the stores entirely  surrounded by this protecting hedge.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had the evidence of our own eyes that the place was  inhabited by some unknown creatures, and there was that of Maple  Whites sketchbook to show that more dreadful and more dangerous  monsters might still appear.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We want to have  a good look at our neighbors before we get on visitin terms.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We shifted our  position from among the tickladen bushes until we came to a small  clearing thickly surrounded by trees upon all sides.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We cannot do less than call it Ixodes Maloni.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We forbore to light a fire or to make  any unnecessary sound.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We supped and camped at the very edge of the cliff, quenching our  thirst with two bottles of Apollinaris which were in one of the cases.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were still discussing it,  endeavoring to adjust our minds to these new conditions, when a  singular scene in the plain below arrested our attention.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We nearly killed you with a stone at the cave, he cried; but this is  better.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were too astounded to speak.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had each bandoliers of cartridges.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We all have our professions, and soldierin is mine.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We can at least all reach the summit, said he.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were a disconsolate party, for nothing could have been more  minute than our investigation, and it was absolutely certain that there  was no single point where the most active human being could possibly  hope to scale the cliff.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have shaken off some of that  horrible insect life which is the bane of tropical travel.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We could not ourselves see  whence the rock had come, but our halfbreed servants, who were still  at the opening of the cave, said that it had flown past them, and must  therefore have fallen from the summit.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had gathered in a little group at the bottom of the chasm, some  forty feet beneath the mouth of the cave, when a huge rock rolled  suddenly downwardsand shot past us with tremendous force.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were too excited to return to the camp, but must make our first  exploration at once.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We  ordered the camp to be pitched, however, and, leaving the Indians to  arrange it, we four, with the two halfbreeds, proceeded up the narrow  gorge.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We can only accept  his guidance and follow on to the westward.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We moved off in silence, and continued to coast round the line of  cliffs, which were as even and unbroken as some of those monstrous  Antarctic icefields which I have seen depicted as stretching from  horizon to horizon and towering high above the mastheads of the  exploring vessel.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were passing along the edge  of this cover when my eye was caught by the gleam of something white  within it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We traveled entirely by compass, and  once or twice there were differences of opinion between Challenger and  the two Indians, when, to quote the Professors indignant words, the  whole party agreed to trust the fallacious instincts of undeveloped  savages rather than the highest product of modern European culture.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We will  kill you if we can, said the men in the east.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We found that all our possessions fitted very easily into  the two canoes, and we divided our personnel, six in each, taking the  obvious precaution in the interests of peace of putting one Professor  into each canoe.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have not, it is true,  ascended the plateau, but it lies before us, and even Professor  Summerlee is in a more chastened mood.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We should soon come upon rapids, he  explained, which would make its further use impossible.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We sprang to our feet  with a gasp of astonishment as Challenger, in a round, boyish strawhat  with a colored ribbonChallenger, with his hands in his jacketpockets  and his canvas shoes daintily pointing as he walkedappeared in the  open space before us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have only to return home and  report him as the brazen imposter that he is.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We looked at each other in a bewildered silence, which was broken by a  discordant burst of derisive laughter from Professor Summerlee.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have seven more minutes, said he.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are to be companionswhat?","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We may  get a scoop, if we are lucky.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had a little difference at first.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We know  equally that it must be a very difficult one, otherwise the creatures  would have come down and overrun the surrounding country.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We can only suppose that he must have made his way to the summit and  seen it there.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We progress, do we not?","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We will now  leave the dead American and proceed with my narrative.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We reentered the room which we had left so tumultuously ten minutes  before.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We cant all be Stanleys and Burtons, said I; besides, we dont get  the chance,at least, I never had the chance.","nextSentStartsWith":"give"},{"sentence":"We had been  friends, quite good friends; but never could I get beyond the same  comradeship which I might have established with one of my

the passage.","nextSentStartsWith":"it"},{"sentence":"We went with a back  somersault down the front steps.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"We shall have a coalition presently, he boomed, looking from his wife  to me and puffing out his enormous chest.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We know, therefore, that there is a way up.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We cant have this reign of terror, Mr.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We must bring the man to his bearings.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We could notor at least  we had not succeeded up to date in making organic life in our  laboratories out of inorganic materials.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We can start tomorrow.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are sending home one of our local Indians who  is injured, and I am committing this letter to his charge, with  considerable doubts in my mind as to whether it will ever come to hand.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We will kill you if we can.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We will kill you if we  can, said the men in the north.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We drew them up, therefore, and concealed  them among the bushes, blazing a tree with our axes, so that we should  find them again.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are, in truth, as far from any human aid as if we were in the moon.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We did indeed, but they were of a terrible and most unexpected nature.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had proceeded some five more miles when again we saw a white arrow  upon the rocks.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had had no  food for many hours, and were very weary with the stony and irregular  journey, but our nerves were too strung to allow us to halt.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We made our way backthe whole gorge was not more than a  quarter of a mile deepand then suddenly the quick eyes of Lord John  fell upon what we were seeking.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We withdrew hurriedly from the chasm, our minds full of this new  development and its bearing upon our plans.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We made a march that day which totaled some twoandtwenty miles,  without any change in our prospects.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We all sat in amazed silence round the fire, like the heroes  of Virgil when the Harpies came down upon them.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We can never get across, I gasped.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are,  accordin to my ideas, invadin a new country, which may or may not be  chockfull of enemies of sorts.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had turned away from the edge, and had penetrated about fifty yards  of close brushwood, when there came a frightful rending crash from  behind us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We could only stand there staring in  amazement.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had been natives of the world; now we were natives of the  plateau.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We realized that  Zambo spoke the truth, and that it would be impossible for him to keep  them.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We will advance.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We must never go so far that we cant get back to our base.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We then slowly and cautiously set  forth into the unknown, following the course of the little stream which  flowed from our spring, as it should always serve us as a guide on our  return.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We all stopped to examine that monstrous spoor.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We may have traveled two or three miles in all, keeping to the  right of the line of the stream, when we came upon a considerable  opening in the trees.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were walking  slowly towards these rocks, among bushes which reached over our waists,  when we became aware of a strange low gabbling and whistling sound,  which filled the air with a constant clamor and appeared to come from  some spot immediately before us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We saw him peep over them and give a  gesture of amazement.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We beat at them with the stocks of our guns, but there was nothing  solid or vulnerable to strike.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We kept to  our camp all day, therefore, Lord John busying himself, with such help  as we could give him, in raising the height and thickness of the thorny  walls which were our only defense.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We clapped our hands to our ears to shut out that nerveshaking appeal.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We shall know in the morning, said Lord John.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have been privileged to overhear a prehistoric tragedy, the sort of  drama which occurred among the reeds upon the border of some Jurassic  lagoon, when the greater dragon pinned the lesser among the slime,  said Challenger, with more solemnity than I had ever heard in his  voice.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"we all cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We cant  afford to take chances in a country like this.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We dont know  who or what may be near us.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We know roughly that this  plateau is not larger than an average English county.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We can only imagine, therefore, that the balance of  Nature is preserved by some check which limits the numbers of these  ferocious creatures.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We saw many small animals, such as porcupines, a scaly anteater, and a  wild pig, piebald in color and with long curved tusks.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have spent two long days in exploration, said he, and we are no  wiser as to the actual geography of the place than when we started.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We heard a row, as if your foot had slipped.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had seen several of the sort, the  runs of various wild beasts, during our expeditions.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We must move, and move quick!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We relied upon the fact that we could count  upon the good word of those whom we had rescued to ensure a warm  welcome from their fellows.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We fitted him up  with an empty beef tin and he is off.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We four white men walked in the  rear with rifles loaded and ready.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were indeed a sorry crew, and I did  not wonder to see our Indian companions glance back at us occasionally  with horror and amazement on their faces.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are assembled now and ready.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We seem to be drifting very far from the object of this expedition,  Lord John.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have been privileged, he cried, strutting about like a gamecock,  to be present at one of the typical decisive battles of historythe  battles which have determined the fate of the world.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We also continually visited their caves, which  were most remarkable places, though whether made by man or by Nature we  have never been able to determine.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were soon to discover that it was not  so, and that he was still there upon tolerance.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had never  before seen them save at night,  and indeed they are nocturnal animals  save when disturbed in their lairs, as these had been.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had little time to watch them, however, for in an instant they had  overtaken the fugitives and were making a dire slaughter among them.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are also unable to construct any kind of bridge  which may take us back to the pinnacle from which we came.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We stood with bitter hearts staring at this unexpected obstacle.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had not gone thirty yards before a great  black opening loomed in the wall.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We stared in amazement.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We hastened towards it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are through, boys!","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We satisfied ourselves  that with the help of our rope we could find our way down, and then  returned, rejoicing, to our camp to make our preparations for the next  evening.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had hoped that we should find upon  our return that no one was so dense as to dispute our joint  conclusions.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We bobbed and  grinned in front of each other.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are getting our house ready, said  Gladys.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We have no secrets.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We are shipbuilders.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were young; we  craved thrills, and God knows we got them that day; yet by comparison  with that through which I have since passed they were as tame as a  PunchandJudy show.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were aboard an  American shipwhich, of course, was not armed.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We must grin and bear it, she replied after a  moment.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were approaching the Uboat at half speed now, and I could almost  distinguish the features of the men upon her deck.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We  heard a loud explosion apparently directly above us; the craft trembled  to the shock which threw us all to the deck.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We cant  do it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We ran steadily along upon the surface, making good  time.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We  worked upon the engine all that day and night and half the following  day.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We were  steaming along slowly upon the surface, my orders having been to  proceed at half speed until we could take an observation and determine  our position.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We still have the compass and the  sun, said Olson.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We kept steadily to our westward course, and as the U33 was one of the  fastest submersibles we had ever turned out, I knew that we must be  pretty close to the North American coast.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We kept to our westerly course for several hours when the lookouts cry  announced a sail.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We could not lie there in the middle of the  Atlantic and starve to death if there was any way out of it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had no opportunity for drill; but every man had been  posted as to his duties, and the German members of the crew understood  that it was obedience or death for them, as each was accompanied by a  man with a pistol.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We addressed  both to any British agent with the request that the owners of the  Balmen be reimbursed; but whether or not they were, I do not know.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We cruised for a long time, sinking many vessels, all but one by  gunfire, but we did not come across a German raider.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had all the Germans we could take care of.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We threw his body overboard.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We didnt know what  course we had been holding, and there was no way of finding out, as we  could no longer trust the compass, not knowing what Benson had done to  it.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We all drank water together this  morning.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We  must find water on Caprona, or we must die.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We had not as yet really commenced to  suffer for lack of water; but I knew that it would not be long before  we did, and so at the first streak of dawn I moved in again and once  more took up the hopeless survey of the forbidding coast.","nextSentStartsWith":"well,"},{"sentence":"We must believe the other until we prove it
