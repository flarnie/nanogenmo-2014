edged sword.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The advice is good, said Erik, and I will follow it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The Iron Ram, and other ships, to the number of fifteen, then closed in  about the Serpent, and, as they advanced, the archers on their decks  opened battle by shooting their arrows high in air, so that they fell  into the midst of Olafs men in an unremitting shower.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The good ship creaked in all her  beams, but no great damage was done.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The king then went into the foreroom, unlocked the high seat chest and  took therefrom many bright and sharp swords which he carried out in his  arms and put down among his men.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The vikings were still cautious of Olafs  champions.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The king flung his weapon, taking good aim; but this spear  missed its mark as the first had done.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The number of his men had become woefully small,  and yet, as he believed, Olaf Triggvison was still unwounded,  undaunted, and as full of confident hope as he had ever shown himself  to be.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The  other was assailed by arrows and spears, but instantly he turned over  and held his shield above him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The tale is told that the king, as he swam beneath the cover of his  shield, stripped off his armour and, making his way to the land, went  away on a pilgrimage to Rome.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"THE WEST SEA SAILING.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The morning sun glanced on  their helmets and coats of mail, and in the still air the clash of  preparation rang far up the pineclad hillside.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The party by this time were so close  that they had perforce to halt, with some clash of armour, and  again their captain cried,    Are you deaf?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The blackbearded man looked at him with an air of some  astonishment, and then answered shortly,    They call me Ketill; but what is that to you?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The last man sprang on board, the oars dipped in the still water,  and as the little fleet moved slowly down the fiord the crowd on  shore gradually dispersed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The tide of Norse energy was not yet at the full, the fury and the  terror were waxing fast, and the fever of unrest was ever  spreading through the North.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The night is fair, Estein.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The burners of Olaf have long gone out of Norway, have they not?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The burners knew my father too well to bide at  home and welcome him; and since then no man has told aught of  them, save that Thord the Tall at one time raided much in England,  and boasted widely of the burning.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The Orkneys more likely, said Thorolf, who had sailed in those  seas before.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The ship drew so near that they could plainly see the men on  board, and conspicuous among them the tall form of Thorkel  appeared in the bow.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The stout searover turned with a gleam of grim humour in his eyes  to the enjoyment of what he fully expected would be his last drink  on earth, and on both ships men buckled on their armour and  bestirred themselves for fight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The fates, however, were against  them.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The  halfstunned Liot was seized by one of his followers, and bundled  back on board his ship; and for the time the day was saved.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The point of the blade passed in at his  breast and out between his shoulders, and at the same instant the  battleaxe fell.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The girl screamed; and then, as he scrambled out none the worse  and only a little the wetter, an irresistible inclination to laugh  overcame her.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The thought passed through his  mind, She must not know me as son to the King of Sogn till I have  done some deed more worthy of a prince of Yngves line than lose a  battle with two Orkney Vikings.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The seas were deserted, and the atmosphere seemed  charged with an air of calm loneliness.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The early fathers called it the Holy Isle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The old man looked for a moment as though he would have questioned  him further on his family.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The tumultuous stir of battle was forgotten as they brought him  supper and gently bound his wounds.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The petitions,  eloquent and brief in his northern tongue, rose above the  throbbing of the roost outside, and died away into a prayerful  silence;

calls us Northmen, and we  cannot bide at home.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The hermits black mood passed away, and was followed by an  attitude of grave distance towards his guest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The hermit was alone.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The deed was but an act of justice on one who had  beguiled our kinswoman; but the dead man had many friends, and the  king hearkened neither to Kolskeggs offers of atonement nor to my  petitionsto mine, who had never asked aught of mortal man  before!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The first man who came out I clove to  the waist, for none in Norway had greater skill at arms than I.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The time went by until the hour was hard on midnight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The gods have sent for me, he thought.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"THE HALL OF LIOT.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The pleasantest memories  were distorted by the ghost of that old blood feud; his murdered  brother called aloud for vengeance; in the wash of the waves and  the creaking of the timbers he heard the hermit recite again the  story of the burning, and through it all a voice cried, Farewell!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The sun at that season rises early.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The great  oily swell broke into spouts of foam at the clifffoot, and all  along the face of the precipice they could see innumerable seafowl  clinging to the rock.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The leaders of the hazardous expedition watched  it closing in upon them with growing apprehension.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The respect due to rank in Norway was little more than the proud  Norseman chose to pay, and it was with small deference to his  prince that Ketill answered,    You are fey, I think, Estein.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The men within earshot  were too much surprised at this sudden change from Esteins usual  manner to his followers to do more than look in astonishment at  the dispute, and in another instant the blades would have clashed,  when Helgi rushed between them.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The wrath of the gods is upon me,  and I am not myself.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The ship crept under the cliffs with hardly any way  on at all, and Helgi, in despair, saw the golden hour slipping by.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The fighting fire died out, the longing for action was choked, and  in their place what was as nearly a spell as can fall on mortal  men had fallen on him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The fog lifts!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The men heard the cry, and ceasing their awestruck talk, looked  eagerly at the fastwidening rifts in the white shroud.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The summer night sky with its pale stars  appeared in lakes above, and below, the fog rose from the water  like steam.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The pilot shook his head.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The men were right, he thought; it was a magic mist.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The night is light, said he, and there will still be some fire  in the hall.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The very dogs will  be drunk, and I think it will not be so difficult as it seems.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The trolls take you!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The hall of Liot was very dark and still.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The men will be on us.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The dogs are after us!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The man in charge had seen nothing of him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The hour is yet early.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The tale was the burning of Laxafiord, and the  voice was my brother Olafs.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The sea was never silent, the gulls flew inland and the cormorants  sat stormbound in their caves; brief glimpses of cold and sunny  weather passed as abruptly as they came, and in the smoke of a  driftwood fire Osla plied her needle and followed the wanderings  of her thoughts.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The hermit seemed hardly to comprehend her words.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The care of him had at least the effect of turning Oslas thoughts  away from herself.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The burning at Laxafiord?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The flames leapt  higher than the pine trees, the women shriekedI hear them now!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The steelbound box?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The voice died away, and Osla was left alone.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"THE MESSAGE OF THE RUNES.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The others who had sailed with them laid no  such restraint on their tongues, and stories of a spell and an  Orkney witch, vague and contradictory, but none the less eagerly  listened to and often repeated, went the round of the country.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The spell is lifting, jarl, he said; Estein is becoming himself  again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The people there have slain some of his followers,  forced him to fly for his life, and refused to pay scatt to a  Norse king.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The man was holding out something towards him, and when  he had caught Esteins eye, he said respectfully,    I was charged to give this token to you, sire.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The whole writing ran: An old man, a maiden, and a  spell.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The message made a sharp impression on Esteins mind.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The message of the Runes was ringing in his mind, and the spirit  of roving and adventure boiling up again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The country  they were going to lay among the lakes of North Sweden.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The  sun came out hot by day, but at nights it felt very cold and  frosty.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The rude wooden  houses straggled along the edge of a great frozen lake, whose  snowpowdered surface stretched for miles and miles in an unbroken  sheet of dazzling whiteness.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The men halted, and grasped their weapons, and in expectant  silence their leaders watched a small troop defile out of the  town.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The  others I shall have feasted here in the town at my own cost, and  with them I shall leave my two young sonshe indicated, as he  spoke, the two lads.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The marshes are firm and frozen, and the snow lies nowhere very  deep.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The air grew colder and  colder, till their hands and faces tingled with the frost.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The scene as they entered was strange and stirring.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The man hastily stepped back, but not before he had found time to  whisper,    Beware, Estein!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The whole country has been prepared against our coming, the  people told to leave their houses, and the kings own hirdmen set  as decoys in our path.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The hardest part of the business now remained.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The high table at which they sat was lit by two great torches set  on stands.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The Jemtlander turned on him savagely and answered,    Think you I have to succour you of my own pleasure?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The man stamped his foot wrathfully, and turned sharply away as  though he would leave him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The moon had come out  of the clouds, and by its light Estein tried to scan the features  of his companion.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The man went straight up to the  door and knocked.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The gods indeed have dealt heavily with thee, said Atli, and it  is at their bidding that I called thee here.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"THE MAGICIAN.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The look of the first figure caught Esteins eye at once,  and he felt his heart suddenly beat quickly.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The girl had been  too far off to read her features, her figure was not really like,  and, most weighty argument, it was out of all reason that she  should be in this land of forests, so distant from her island  home.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The bloodred  glamour of a frosty sunset was fading from the sky as the  daylight died away; all round the wood was populous with shadows;  and over its ragged edge the moon hung pale and faint.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The man, so far as he could discern in the waning  light, wore the native skin coat and cap, and seemed to hold in  his hands a bow ready to shoot.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The  blades were on the point of crossing, when his enemy stopped  short, dropped his point, and then burst into an uncontrollable  fit of laughter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The black traitor Thorar, and with him some ten or twelve others,  doubtless all the sober men at the feast.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The  woodman was in the village at the feast, and his wife, good woman,  had been in bed for the last two hours, and strangely enough had  not seen us.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The man loves not Norsemen, yet has he saved thy  fosterbrothers life, and likely, too, those of Ketill and all  his company.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The woman has come in!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The fire had been raked up to burn brightly, and Jomar, as before,  lay fast asleep beside it; but between Helgi and the blaze stood  the old seer and the hooded and cloaked form of a woman.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The door closed behind him,  and then saying to himself, Now or never, my friend, Helgi  quietly slipped into his sheepskin coat, and stepping softly so  as not to disturb Estein or the seer, came boldly down the ladder.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The old mans face grew dark with displeased  surprise, yet he hesitated for an instant, as if uncertain what to  do.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"THE LAST OF THE LAWMAN.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The great lake and the open country lay below  them, white still, but with all the sheen and sparkle off them,  and overhung now by a grey, wetweather sky.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The battle was  at an end.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"the cowardly rabble could not even fight till  we had come to join in the sport.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The man took the dagger sullenly and answered,    I hope never more to see either of you.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The strong and foolish fight with weapons suited to their hands,  said Thorar; the weak and wise with weapons suited to their  heads.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The dying man laughed a ghastly laugh.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The lawman had gone to his last account, his bolt  impotently shot, and his enemies standing triumphantly over him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The gods have bidden me cross the seas, replied Estein, and  they will steer my ship, whatever haven I choose.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The men made no reply, but seemed to whisper among themselves, and  Helgi repeated his question.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The King smote upon Esteins ears like a knell, and he guessed  the earls news before he heard it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The young king himself went  about bravely, seeing to everything but speaking little.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The ashes they  reverently gathered up and placed within a copper bowl, a lid they  made of twelve shield bosses, the gifts were gathered and placed  all round, and then the spademen heaped the mound above Hakon,  King of Sogn.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The first night of the feast arrived.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The young king sat in his fathers high seat, the  highestborn and most honoured guests ranged beside him, and those  of humbler standing in the farther places.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The trolls take my wife!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The girls must be  less fair now, or a gallant king will not stay single long.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The man went down the hall again, and Earl Sigvald exclaimed  testily,    Some thralls sweetheart doubtless, come to babble her  complaints.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The king is feasting with his  guests.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The words were almost lost in the hood that shrouded her head.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"The  writing bade me seek King Hakon.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"}],"i":[{"sentence":"I was banished for mine  own fault, thenceforth Thord exiled me for his.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have seen him, he answered evasively.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I ask your pardon, Mistress Osla.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have heard of them, said Estein, half to himself.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I shall press his claims myself, said Estein, rising from his  seat.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have a message for the king, replied the man.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I could name one fair maid, said Helgi, glancing at the king,  but in Esteins eye he saw a warning look.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I saw your  mother married, Estein, and a fair maid she was.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I will yet keep my promise to thee!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I know not his name, but treachery, he said, was determined; and  I stopped all drink thereafter, and there was nothing at all left  then but to play with dice and sleep.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I will warrant your doings will make me laugh rather than envy,  said Ketill.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I slew them in the outset of the battle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I had a strange dream last night, replied Helgi.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I thought I heard the voice of a girl; but when I woke more  fully, it was gone, indeed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I shall say nothing to any one, Helgi answered more soberly.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have  only just arrived.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I should ask your  pardon.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I fear my habit pleases not your eye, he said at last, striving  to control his countenance.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I  shrewdly suspected, from my memory of the way I had come  overnight, that he was leading me back to King Bues hall, and  meant on our parting to put a horde of his rascally fellows in my  way.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I laid the man out  under the shadow of the fence, where he could not well be seen  save by such as had more clearness of vision than becomes the  guests of so hospitable a monarch as King Bue, and having stripped  him of his coat and put it round mine own shoulders, I took his  place and awaited your coming.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I left that hall, accursed of the gods, and over full, I  fear, of drunken men, in the manner you witnessed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I doubt it not, replied his friend, with a smile; you have the  look of one who is high in favour with himself.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I shall have one other shot.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have turned sluggard, it seems, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I accept the counsel, Atli, he cried, springing to his feet.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I  had read the stars, and talked with divers magicians and men  skilled in the wisdom of things unseen.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I could not visit Hakonstad; I could  not even stay in the land of my birth.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I tell thee, Estein, many fair years  lie before thee.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have left my truest friend and twenty stout

been long  asleep, and now I know that this wakefulness you see is but the  clearness of a man before he dies.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have that on my mind that you must hear  before I die.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I go to Norway, replied Estein.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I had forgotten Liot, said Estein.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I forgot my kinsfolk and my country, forgot all but Osla.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I would slay him, Helgi, like a dog, were it not that something  within me bids me ask in this wise the wishes of Odin.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I will slay Liot Skulison for you; in fair fight if  you will, though I think not he deserves such a chance.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I tell you, my brother, you are under a spell; let us  seek some magician who will cure you, and not rashly look for  death when you are wearied with sleepless nights and black magic.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I like not a midnight murder, and Liot and I have not yet decided  who is the better man.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I asked if you would follow me.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I think so, he said at length.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have come to meet Liot tonight, Estein replied, and turning  away he paced the deck in deep thought.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I was wrong, Ketill, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I shall make these cravens row.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I shall not lose my ship that you  may the sooner feed the fishes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I thought you would leave us little say, Estein, when once you  were aroused, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have lately heard tell of another.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I will call Ketill and the  Orkneyman, and we four will hold council here.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I cannot give you a storm, I fear, laughed Helgi, but you can  have fighting enough tonight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I knew not myself when they would come.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I know these spells, Estein; they have been cast on men by other  maids before now.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have been so long alone  that they had begun to seem like dreammen.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have wept for thee,  Estein; I have mourned thee as dead.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I know  you nowtoo late!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I would be alone, he answered, and walked quickly past her.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I hear Osla!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I am Thord the Tall, the burner of Olaf  Hakonson.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have burned them like rats; I have left their homesteads  smouldering!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I was a heathen then, as thou art; I worshipped the gods of the  North, and the hammer of Thor was my symbol on the ocean.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I once sang such songs, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I cannot tell you why, he went on, but today I feel that my  hour has come to rove again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I  will listen, but do not keep me long.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have a new song to sing you.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I am under a spell, he would say to himself, and stride more  quickly over the heather, and then catch himself smiling at the  thought of some word or look of Oslas.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I  have thought of them at night when the stars shone and the wind  sighed in the trees.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I am known as Vandrad, the son of a noble landowner in Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have  told him we would give him shelter and food, and such tending as  his wounds may require.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have brought a shipwrecked seafarer, father, she said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I sometimes think so myself, she answered with a smile.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I know, indeed, that I have to thank you for my life, such as it  is.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I thought at first that you  were drowned.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I go before, he said, and fell on the deck with a clatter of  steel.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I shall have tales of a merry fight to tell to Odin tonight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I  think with you, Estein, that the bottom here will make as soft a  restingplace for us as elsewhere.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I seek mercy from no man, answered Estein.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I wager my goldhandled sword he is  drunk.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I like not this country, said Ulf.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I read the stars too well, said Estein grimly between his teeth,  clinging to the straining tiller, and watching the rollers rising  higher.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I should like to spill a little Scottish blood, and mayhap carry  off a maid or two, said Thorolf Hauskoldson, a young giant from  the upland dales.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I was but a child when my brother was burned like a fox in his  hole at Laxafiord.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I  cannot punish Thor because he suffered Harald to drown, but if  ever in my life it be my fate to meet Thord the Tall, Snaekol  Gunnarson, or Thorfin of Skapstead, there shall be but one man  left to tell of our meeting.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I wished to know what Odin thought of Helgi Sigvaldson, said  Estein with a smile.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I am trying to  read the stars.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I  would that I too were sailing to the southern lands.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I said today  that he would not gain victory over us if he had the image of Thor in  his stem.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I am no great reader  of dreams, O king; but this one has sorely troubled me, for I fear that  Earl Sigvaldi is a treacherous friend, and that he is now minded to do  you an injury.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I am of a  long lived race, and, since I am now a man of peace and no lover of  bloodshed, I am not likely to be mixed up in any warsat least, not  wars of my own making.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I am hoping that  you will soon see your way to coming north to Thrandheim, there to  spend many happy summer months with

your new religion.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I have commanded that  Norway shall be a Christian land, and I shall have it so, even if I  lose my own life in bringing it about.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"I am willing, therefore, to be  present at your worship at any time, and to witness your greatest  ceremony of blood

 of every land in Scandinavia.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But some of  the Swedish soldiers who had been watching the duel rushed forward,  and, raising their fallen king, carried him off on board another of his  ships, while Olaf Triggvison went aft along the crowded decks, and men  fell beneath his blows, as the ripe grain falls before the mowers  scythe.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But when I chose her crew, I did not know  that I was appointing a stem defender who was both red and adread.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But who owns those  fine ships to the left of the Danes?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But what chief flies the standards to the right?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But we are not afraid of  those cowards, for no more courage is there in Danes than in wood  goats.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But he answered  proudly that he wished all men, both friends and foes, to see that he  shunned no danger.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But not for an  instant did Olaf Triggvison shrink from the unequal encounter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But whoever they be, it seems that they are not altogether  friendly to us.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But the ships had still some way on them  and the current was with them.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But as he drew the string he saw the great  dusky bird open its stout beak.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But now  it is clear that he has but the heart of a chicken, for he is too  cowardly to fight against Olaf Triggvison and dares not avenge his own  fathers death.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Earl Erik did not move.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But they were yet too far off to be clearly recognized.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But King Sweyn had still to take his throw.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But the next summer is a long while off, and it may bewho can  say?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But on a certain day there came a small fishing boat into the bay, and  dropped anchor near to the earls longship.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But he knew that King Sweyn Forkbeard was  his bitterest enemy, and that there was danger in passing so near to  Denmark, and he thought it well to have a large number of battleships  in his train in case of need.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Olaf always shook his head and asked her if she did not  think that there was wealth enough for them both in Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Thorberg said, nevertheless, that there were many things  that he would have improved.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But now you are a kinga great and glorious king.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But you are taller  and stronger than when last we met.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  I have found you at last, and now I crave your help for the mercy of  God!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But it was not in religious matters alone that Olaf Triggvison  exercised his wisdom and his rule.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in good time King Sweyn heard of the quarrel that had befallen  between Queen Sigrid and her young Norwegian suitor.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in these days even now  told of it befell that Queen Gunnhild was stricken with an illness and  died.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But remember  this, that the insult you have offered me and the blow you have struck  me shall be your death!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But while the wooden stairway was still creaking under his  tread, Queen Sigrid called after him in bitterest anger:    Go, then, O proud and stubborn king.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But the king carried a stout  stick with a heavy gold head.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But they considered that he had no right to dictate to them;  so they turned this summons into one of war, and drew together, both  thane and thrall, from all parts of Thrandheim.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Rand cried out at him, saying that nothing would induce him to  believe in Christ.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in the wintertime he went back into Trondelag.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But as the night wore on Karks  weariness got the better of him, but he tossed about and muttered in  his sleep.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But we  must take heed to our lives first of all.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  suddenly, as they drew nearer to him, they turned about towards the  land and fled in all haste.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But as soon as Olaf was out of the cabin Thorir  rose, wakeful enough now that he was alone, and took from under him a  longbow which he placed in the rack.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But whosoever he be, I shall surely find him and punish him!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Thorir shook his head.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But even when the business  was over, Thorir did not seem willing to leave, but stood near to Olaf  looking searchingly into his face.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But I cannot take it as a free gift.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But it seems that  the greater power which he afterwards acquired disturbed the fine  balance of his mind, and he became deceitful, even to his nearest  friends, and cruel to a degree which presently won for him the hatred  of his people, who murmured against him in secret while fearing to  break out into open rebellion.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But the attempt  was useless.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But on the seventh night the danger was passed, and thereafter  he speedily grew well.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But the hermit shook his head.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But of these  adventures there remains no record.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Ethelred was a man of quite another stamp from the valiant  Earldorman of East Anglia, and he adopted the fatal system of looking  to gold to do the work of steel.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at last one of Olafs captainsJustin it wasran  forward, sword in hand and shield on arm, towards the bridge.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But there is the bridge by which we may cross, returned Guthmund.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But let us all  be brave, for we have our homes to defend, and God will not desert us  in our hour of danger.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But ere the sun went  down Olaf had got the victory.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But he was not then prepared to enter battle, as many  of his men had come ashore without their body armour and shields,  deeming these too heavy to carry in sunny weather.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at  the monasteries and holy places he made no such return, for he vas a  great enemy of Christianity.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But our forces are very small compared with the great host  of men and ships that Hakon could muster at any moment, and to attempt  this journey you propose would only mean disaster.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Olaf shook his head.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But when he joined his other fleet in Lyme Firth, he went  straightway on board his dragonship and held council with Kolbiorn.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But had Earl Hakon of Lade been able to look into the  future, and see the disasters that awaited him at the hands of this  fair haired young viking, he would surely have swept every fiord and  channel in Norway in the endeavour to drag the runaway back and bring  him to the doom that he had so easily escaped.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Vagn sat chatting  and joking with his companions, and there was much laughter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But strong and valiant though he was, he could not hold his  own against the crowd of warriors then gathered about him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  Sigvaldi, being cold, had taken one of the oars to warm himself, so  that the man at the rudder was killed instead.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But these two champions were  braver than their chief.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at last Earl Sigvaldi began to lose heart.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Olaf, ever  hopeful and buoyant, trusted that with very little trouble on his own  part, he could readily prove to the people that he, the direct  descendant of Harald Fairhair, had claims of which neither Sigvaldi nor  even the great Earl Hakon could justly boast.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But it chanced that ere  his turn came round all the company were either asleep or so full of  strong drink that they could not listen, so in the end he made no vow  whatsoever.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But when I look at  you, and see your silken hair and your fair skin, it seems to me that  you must be of kingly birth.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But the ships and  their equipment were all pronounced seaworthy and in good condition;  so, after the vows had been made, there was held a great feast, and  Olaf was chosen as a captain under Earl Sigvaldi, holding the command  of his own division of the Jomsburg fleet.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But as the  fight grew fiercer Olafs berserks worked themselves to a wild fury,  and, led by Olaf and Kolbiorn, they made a rush upon the enemys  forecastle, carrying all before them as an autumn wind carries the  withered leaves.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  now Olaf had managed to get his vessel between the two other ships,  and, having the wind in his sail and his oars at work, he quickly  outdistanced the viking, and sped along at a great rate towards the  sinking trading ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But when he got  within arrow shot of the stranger he suddenly altered his course,  crossing her bows.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But most of all, they wondered of what kin he had been born that he  should so easily and with such little effort excel all men they had  known.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But this time I will myself take the lead, and  let Kolbiorn or any other of our company follow.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  Thorgils was unable to determine the matter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But when the two were side by side the resemblance  ceased, for then Olaf was seen to be both the taller and the more  muscular; his hair was seen to be more golden and silken, his skin more  purely fair; his eyes, too, were brighter and larger than those of  Kolbiorn, and his teeth more even and white.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at  night he had Sigurd Eriksons body carried down to the beach with all  the other men who had been of King Valdemars host.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Sigurd Erikson was found dead in his cell.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But most of all he  loved to take the tiller in his hand and steer the vessel through the  dangers of the wind swept sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But suddenly it seemed that a new light came into his clear blue  eyes, and a fuller vigour into his strong young limbs.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But to be placed at the head of Some hundreds of well tried  warriors and told to lead them against an enemy, this was a matter of  which he had as yet only vaguely dreamed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at the midday I came to  a firm footing on the beach.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But no sooner was he ashore than the people told him that they  were no longer the subjects of King Valdemar but of a new king whom  they had chosen for themselves.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in these matters it was not his training alone that aided him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But these arts and this religion would not alone fit him for fulfilling  his ambition.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But nothing certain could he learn, for he  dared not say that the woman he sought was the widow of King Triggvi,  and when he told of her fairness those whom he questioned only shook  their heads.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But if it be that you have any hope of finding her, then it would be  well if you made that journey you speak of.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But ever as he grew older  he thought more of her, and it pained him very much to know that even  now, when he was living in comfort, with good food and rich apparel,  she, to whom he owed so much, was perhaps labouring as a bondswoman  under some cruel master.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Sigurds eyes were fixed upon Queen  Allogia, who now slowly rose from her seat and held up her hand to  silence the loud murmur of voices that filled the hall.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But as he is still little  more than a child in years the penalty will not be death, but the  payment of a heavy fine.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Jarl  Klerkon was a man whose skill and prowess have made him well known on  all the seas where the vikings are wont to do battle, and I think he  might easily have defended himself against this child, who, as you have  heard, attacked him face to face in the full daylight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in the midst of his  dreaming there came to him the remembrance of the crime that he had  just committed, and he began to dread that King Valdemar might hold him  guilty, and order him to be slain.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But now as they made out to sea vikings fell on them, and took both  men and money.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But even here, continued Sigurd, Queen Gunnhilds enmity followed  her.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Erik attacked them unawares with a great army  at Tunsberg and won the day.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But there were two of his brothers who would not yield to him, and who  yet peacefully ruled in the realms over which their father had placed  them.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Erik escaped with four men, secured his  fathers protection, and for a time there was peace.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But no sooner had this unwise course been taken than the sons began to  quarrel more wildly than ever.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But now nothing would suit him but that he should  once more divide his great realm into many provinces.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But the kings  berserks at length took on their fury and won for their master the  greatest battle that has ever been fought in Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But with every year he came nearer to his goal, and those  who opposed him only brought about their own ruin.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in causing this delay King Valdemar was but yielding to the  pleadings of the queen, who had implored him to spare the life of the  handsome young murderer, or at the least to save him from the fury of  the vikings.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But I must first know what  the peace breaker may have to say in his own defence.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But I see that it was  struck from the front.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Sigurd Erikson was wiser, and knew better that his steed was at  last to meet its equal.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But he will never need to claim me.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Klerkon only admired the lads  skill with the longbow, and thought what a goodly warrior he would  make.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at last it came to a trial of  skill with the longbow.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in the matter of  Klerkon, it may be that I shall be before you.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But his  face was very gloomy, and it was easy to see that it was only out of  his love for his uncle that he would by any means agree to forego his  pleasures.","nextSentStartsWith":"did"},{"sentence":"But  having given my word, I cannot go back from it.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"But it so  chanced that the kings steward was spoken of only by his title as the  Hersir Sigurd, and not as the son of Erik of Ofrestead.","nextSentStartsWith":"they"},{"sentence":"But Thorgils and Egbert were still held as  bond slaves and put to hard labour in the kings stables.","nextSentStartsWith":"tell"},{"sentence":"But Olaf  was obstinate.","nextSentStartsWith":"hakon"},{"sentence":"But Olaf quickly pointed out that there were no boats to  be seen, and that, as the horses and dogs were drinking of the water,  it could not be salt like the waters of the great sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"."},{"sentence":"But when  you spoke your mothers name and told me that she was from Ofrestead,  in the Uplands of Norway, then I knew very well that you were telling  me the truth.","nextSentStartsWith":"(verily,"},{"sentence":"But he remembered that on a time some  merchants had come to the coast from a great city in the south called  Mikligardwhich was the Norsemans name for Constantinople,and he  guessed that that might be their journeys end.","nextSentStartsWith":"in"},{"sentence":"But there is one good thing that your thoughtlessness has  done: it has brought us again under one master, so it will go ill if,  working together, we cannot contrive to run away, and join some viking  ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"by"},{"sentence":"But that is not possible.","nextSentStartsWith":"shall"},{"sentence":"But at last the hot sun sank in a blaze  of gold, and the first days journey came to an end.","nextSentStartsWith":"never"},{"sentence":"But his kirtle was gone.","nextSentStartsWith":"dreams"},{"sentence":"But if you will give me one boon I will promise you  that I will wash myself clean and then come back to the chain.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"But if you will shake my hand and tell me that you will not run away,  then I will take off your chain and you shall ride in front of me on my  horse.","nextSentStartsWith":"as"},{"sentence":"But I will warn you that it may go very ill with you  if you tell your story to all strangers as you told it to me.","nextSentStartsWith":"for"},{"sentence":"But this you shall never do!","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"But since you set  so high a value on him for his beauty and his skill, then I give you in  addition this little ring of gold for your good wifes wearing.","nextSentStartsWith":"sit"},{"sentence":"But had I expected  you I should have seen that he had been well washed and decently  clothed.","nextSentStartsWith":"king"},{"sentence":"But at last Olaf gained the mastery, and his adversary lay  panting and exhausted on the coveted straw.","nextSentStartsWith":"nevertheless,"},{"sentence":"But my mother Astrid knew that there was treachery in  thisfor in like manner had Gunnhild beguiled my father,and she  would by no means let me go into the care of my fathers murderers,  and so Gunnhilds messengers went back empty handed.","nextSentStartsWith":"olaf"},{"sentence":"But when  the days grew short and the nights weary and long, and when the wintry  weather came upon us, then she left her hiding place and set forth with  her folk into the Uplands, travelling under the shelter of night.","nextSentStartsWith":"many"},{"sentence":"But as he was  leaving the crowd he met a certain rich merchant of the town, and he  said:    Tell me, Biorn, who is this yellow haired lad that has just proved  himself so skilful at the knife feat?","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"But the young slave only gave a careless  laugh and ran swiftly away.","nextSentStartsWith":"much"},{"sentence":"But the  sad eyed Thorgils paid no heed to the question, but only crept nearer  to the end of the gangboard, and stood there earnestly watching.","nextSentStartsWith":"not"},{"sentence":"But those who were nearer made no answer, for they saw that  the boy was very agile and strong beyond his years.","nextSentStartsWith":"this"},{"sentence":"But his ambition for the praise of the  warriors was greater than his caution, for, in reaching forward to  catch one of the weapons, he lost his balance and fell headlong into  the deep green water beneath.","nextSentStartsWith":"neither"},{"sentence":"But in most instances the records corroborate each  other very exactly, and it may be taken that the leading incidents of  the story are historically true.","nextSentStartsWith":"now"},{"sentence":"But  soon, thinking perhaps to excel those who had gone before him, he took  a second knife from his belt, and juggled with them both with such  skill that the shipmen watching him from under the awning swore by the  hammer of Thor that the feat could never be surpassed.","nextSentStartsWith":"look"},{"sentence":"But before Sigurd could reply a heavy hand was laid upon his shoulder,  and a gruff voice called out his name.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"But I have a foal in  training that will soon beat any horse in Holmgard; ay, even in Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"sigurd"},{"sentence":"But since the lad is yours, what price do you now put upon  him?","nextSentStartsWith":"very"},{"sentence":"But these Angles are good fighting men, I hear, said Sigurd.","nextSentStartsWith":"not"},{"sentence":"But Odin be thanked, he died not like a cow upon a bed of straw, but  with sword in hand like a brave good man.","nextSentStartsWith":"nevertheless,"},{"sentence":"But tell me, boy,  what token have you to prove that you are indeed the child of Triggvi  Olafson?","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"But my mother bade me ever remember that I was a kings  son, and to make myself worthy.","nextSentStartsWith":"but"},{"sentence":"But in good time the friends of Erik were aware of the  messengers; so Erik arrayed Astrid for departure, and gave her good  guides, and sent her eastaway into the Swede realm to one Hakon  Gamle, a friend of his and a man of might, with whom we abode in all  welcome for a long while.","nextSentStartsWith":"now"},{"sentence":"But never once have I seen her or heard  tidings of her since the dread day when we were brought into this land  and sold into bondage.","nextSentStartsWith":"wulfstan"},{"sentence":"But he had us two lads away with

he did not heed his wounds, for  he had conquered.","nextSentStartsWith":"christ"},{"sentence":"But swimming is of little avail where there is no sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"now"},{"sentence":"But do not suppose that I value you so lightly  as did your late master, who thinks, foolish man, that you are no  better than many another bond slave whom he might buy in the

was the son of Triggvi  Olafson, and perhaps he would again be taken into slavery.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"But if Thorgils was to be left behind in  Esthonia then it would not be so easy.","nextSentStartsWith":"down"},{"sentence":"But Olaf drew quickly aside with a flash of  rebellion in his eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"for"},{"sentence":"But it seems that we are journeying away from the  seacoast, and there is little hope that we can win our way on board a  ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"his"},{"sentence":"But to escape without him, that will I never

much excitement, because many of the horses would not fight,  and others were too easily beaten.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But for all this he had lately  become most wilful, and the trouble he was now causing made his uncle  very anxious.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in the present case he might not be able to help  himself, despite his having so positively said that Klerkon should  never carry him off alive.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at last the door was flung  open, and King Valdemar appeared on the threshold, guarded by many  armed men.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But the viking turned and called upon some of his  shipmates to bring forward the dead body of their chief, which they  laid down before the king.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Harald followed these adventurous men who had  thus sought to escape his rule, with the result that he reduced all  these islands to his sway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But I fail to see how this  history can bear upon the story of the boy Ole.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But there were other reasons.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But very soon, urged, it may be, by  Queen Gunnhild, he sought to increase his wealth and to add to his  lands; and when Athelstane died and King Edmund became the monarch of  England Erik Bloodaxe went far into the land, and forcibly drove the  people from their homes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in spite of her misfortune her  ambitions were not dead, for she had many sons growing up, and she had  a mind to make them all kings in Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at last  King Hakon came to his nephews help, and with him pursued the sons of  Gunnhild into Denmark.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Astrid knew full well that there was falseness underlying  this message, and she sent word back to Norway saying that her boy  stood in no need of such help, and that she would herself see that he  was both well nurtured and fitly

forth.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But his life had been spared, and that was  a great matter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But there was yet something that seemed to  trouble them, and at last Rand the Strong came forward before the king.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But we are told that he is only a thrall, and  that there is no hope of our getting the gold from him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Olaf described his mother to the  fishers widow, who bade him fare to a certain yeoman named Einar  Ulfsson, at a farmstead over the hills.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  he bade Olaf to be hopeful, for, said he, I think it may be that  some friendly man has bought her and taken her home to Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But well he knew that to  fit himself for the viking life he must increase his strength of body  and acquire even greater skill than he now had in the use of all  warlike weapons.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But their journey was one of peace, and it was only their martial array  that made him for the moment envious.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But your strength is  greater than your years.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But I am  no more than a boy.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But King Valdemar shook his head.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But none could say that they had ever before set eyes  upon him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in the end she saw that it was for his own good and  advancement that he should go; so she gave him a beautiful banner of  silken embroidery that she had worked with her own hands, told him that  he would be accounted a noble and brave man wheresoever he should  chance to be, and then bade him a last farewell.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But although he was  a viking, and had all the vikings lust for war and plunder, he yet  remembered the time when his own mother had been taken by Jarl Klerkon  and sold into bondage.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But while Olaf watched them, he noticed that Egbert  became more and more ruffled, as he found himself being constantly  baffled by his opponents better play.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But now they were brought nearer, and when all the wreckage of  the fight was cleared away he placed some of his own men on board the  prize, divided the spoil among all his fellowship, and once more sailed  off, well satisfied with his first success.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Egbert of Britain and Kolbiorn Stallare, after  their quarrel over the game of chess, had not been friendly towards  each other, so Egbert was placed in command over one of the other  vessels of the

the bidding of a woman he did not love, and it is to be  remembered that Olaf was still little more than a youth, while Geira  was already well advanced in years.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Olaf Triggvison looked at the  man with quick apprehension, and said:    If you know anything about the journey of Hakon Jarl, tell us at once.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at length  Earl Hakon, who was supporting his son Sweyn against Sigvaldi, saw that  his northern wing was being forced backward, and he hastened to its  aid.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in the thick of the fight Earl Erik Hakonson, with a  throng of men, boarded the galley of Bui the Thick, and in the first  onslaught Bui

Sigvaldi made no signal whatsoever, and only showed, by his extreme  haste, that he was indeed bent upon making an unworthy and cowardly  retreat.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  already it was too late: not only were the fortunes of the fight now  entirely in the hands of the Norwegians, but the storm of hail and  wind, which was growing every moment more severe, made it impossible  for the ships to make headway against its fury.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But the boatman still slept.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But already the folk had  fled from their homes alarmed at the sight of so large a force, and the  invaders landed without the shedding of a drop of blood.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  our going shall not be one day earlier on account of Ethelreds desire  to be rid of us.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But to this Olaf would not agree.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Sigvaldi had now gone back to his stronghold  on the Baltic, in the hope of restoring his scattered company of  vikings.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But as he  passed downward towards the boat that awaited him among the rocks, he  was met by a party of unpeaceful men who fell suddenly upon him with  their swords.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Olaf  stoutly maintained that as it was he who had proposed the expedition,  and as he had the larger number of men and ships, the sole command  should be his own, Sweyn taking the second place.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But under the wretched Ethelred there was no attempt made to  prevent the more fearful desolation of other parts of the kingdom.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But he  did not reckon with King Sweyn Forkbeard.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at length she came to where Olaf stood, with his head  half hidden under his fur hood.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But there was  another who offered yet morea tall young man, with long fair hair and  very clear blue eyes, who wore a very beautiful cloak of crimson silk  bordered with gold lace.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But there was one  who was quite as brave and mighty as heone who named himself Ole the  Esthonian.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But the words had scarcely fallen from his lips when  he realized that he had unwittingly betrayed his long kept secret, for  why else should he look upon this as such glad news if he were not  himself the lost son of this same Queen Astrid?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But he had wealth of his own and in  plenty, and had no great desire to wait for the death of his  brotherinlaw before being raised to the Irish kingship.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But there was something in Olaf Triggvisons nature which compelled  obedience.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But as Olaf Triggvison now  looked upon it from his ships bow, he understood it to be a message of  hope sent from Heaven, beckoning him onward to his native land in the  north, there to avenge his fathers death, to reconquer his realm, and  to reign as the first truly Christian King of Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But let him be made so without  undue haste.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But when Olaf asked her again she shook  her head and said that she was not Earl Hakons keeper, nor knew where  he might be.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But towards morning Earl Hakon leaned back against the rock, with his  head thrown back.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in addition to this  there was the undoubted fact that he was a direct descendant of Harald  Fairhair, and had therefore the greatest of all claims to the kingdom  in which his fathers had reigned.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But for my own part  I have made up my mind never to believe in logs and stones, though they  be in the shape of fiend or man, whose power I do not understand; and  although I have been told that they have great power, yet it seems to  me very unlikely, for I find that those images which are called gods  are in every way uglier and less powerful than myself.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at last Olaf was left  alone beside the fire, with the doors locked.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But still the guest  spoke on, and the king listened enthralled until sleep came over him  and his head fell back.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  if I am to be king in this land I will be obeyed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But such of the peasants  and land owners who had still resisted Christianity, gathered once  more, armed to the teeth and defiant as ever.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But as King Olaf slept there came a  movement at the far end of the hall, where the darkness was deepest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But quicker still was Einar.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Sigrid, who, by reason  of her great pride and the value that she set upon her own charms, was  named Sigrid the Haughty, would have none of them, although often  enough she welcomed them as wooers and listened to their fine speeches  and their flatteries.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in good time she heard of King Olaf the Glorious,  and of his great wealth and his prowess, and of how in his person he  was so tall and handsome, that men could only compare him with Balder  the Beautiful.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  if you would speak with him I will take you to him, for I see that you  are in distress.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But when  the king laid down his hammer and stood up at his full height and  uncovered his head, she saw that he was no ordinary man.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But early the next morning the king and Thorberg went again to the  ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But there was one thing which gave  the queen much trouble, and over which she was for ever fretting.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Thyra  was not satisfied with this constant delay.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But when at last Sigrid heard that Olaf  had given protection to Sweyns sister, and made Thyra his queen, she  renewed her urging with increased earnestness, and so well did she  succeed that Sweyn was roused to great anger against King Olaf, and he  resolved to get ready his forces and abide by Queen Sigrids counsel.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But he remembered that he was not alone in his  desire to humble the monarch of the Norselands.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Olaf turned aside her warnings with a jest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But he knew the extent of  Sweyn Fork Beards forces, and he was content that Olaf should retain  such chances as were afforded by the support of eleven of his best  battleships.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But one die had  broken asunder, showing a three as well as the two sixes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Sweyn said: Wait, and you will see what our good Sigvaldi  will do when he comes into sight!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Earl Erik  the Norseman recognized every one, and told her captains name.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But as they neared the island a  thing happened which caused him to fall back to the rear.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  meanwhile the Long Serpent was overtaken by all her companion ships;  and so it was that she was the last to enter the straits.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But it was noticed that when he  came abreast of the cape whereon the three chiefs had stood, he lowered  his sails and steered his ships nearer inshore.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But when Thorkel the Wheedler came up with the Crane  he shouted aloud to Sigvaldi, asking him why he did not sail.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But for the harm that he can do us,  he might well have stayed at home.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But a  great cry from the Serpents forecastle warned him that his stem men  were having a hard struggle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But never shall it be said  that Olaf Triggvison struck down a foe who was unarmed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But without heeding, the Swede king brought down his sword with a great  sweep, aiming at Olaf Triggvisons head.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Earl Erik had not a moments doubt.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But it was noticed by the earls  vikings that the larger number of the shafts that were shot at them by  the defenders were of Danish or Swedish make, and by this it was judged  that the kings men were using the arrows that had been fired upon them  by their enemies.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But at the foreroom and the stem of  the Serpent the fray was also of the fiercest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But in the same instant  the earl suddenly moved round his head, so that the arrow, meant for  his bared temple, only grazed his ear.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But Einar Eindridson kept his eyes upon the waves  until at last, in the midst of a bright beam of sunlight far away he  saw the shield of King Olaf appear, with its glistening image of the  holy cross.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But now, Helgi, we must sleep while we may; nights may come when  we shall want it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"But  before I fall

or a story of  his own adventures.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He knew that he was in love, hopelessly in love.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was an honest, peaceable man, as  the times went, with a kindly wife, Gudrun by name, and they both  took a friendly interest in the hermits daughter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He came here to escape  men, you say, and now he has to entertain a stranger and a  Viking.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He is faint, and  hears us not.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was aroused by the voice of Osla.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He is a holy Christian man, she said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He looked at her so silently and intently that the blue eyes  drooped and a faint blush rose to the maidens cheeks.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he  is alive.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He and his illlooking crew make a  mighty noise.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he shouted.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He waves to us; there is something behind this, said Estein.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He perchance forgot that Hakon  had other sons.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he said, and what  does Estein Hakonson want with white magic?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He took Esteins hand, looked closely into his eyes for a minute,  and then said solemnly,    Estein Hakonson, this voyage will have an ending other than ye  deem.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He could see some  bringing weapons and provisions down to the shore, and others  busily lading the ships.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He looked  down into the sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried; and then he whispered in Olafs ear, and they  both strode slowly aft to the rail.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He pressed forward to the stairs; but  Kolbiorn Stallare drew him back.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He turned to see who had flung the  javelin and saw King Olaf standing by the poop rail poising a second  spear.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He sent many  of his best men on board, armed with axe and sword.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He boarded her with a vast crowd of his vikings.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He bade  his rowers stop their rowing on the starboard side.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He passed astern of the kings fleet.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He would have known Olaf Triggvison had a score of such men as Kolbiorn  been at his side.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  was, therefore, well able to judge that neither the king of the Danes  nor the king of the Swedes was capable of overcoming so brave and  mighty a warrior as the king of the Norsemen, or of wresting the Long  Serpent from the man who had built her and who knew so well how to  defend his own.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had  fought with his father in the great battle against Sigvaldi and the  vikings of Jomsburg, and from what he had seen on that day of Olaf  Triggvisons prowess, and from what he had since heard of Olafs  warfare in England and other lands, he had made a very true estimate of  the man who now fought in defence of the Long Serpent.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He has taught me enough to enable me to slay such a man as you!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried as he rallied his men.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had already, from a distance, kept up an intermittent fire  of arrows into the midst of the Norse ships, and it may be that he had  thus helped to reduce King Olafs strength.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had made the attack with five and  forty fully manned warships, and yet all this great force had been as  nothing against the superior skill and courage of the defenders.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried as full three score of his  bravest warriors followed close at his back.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he asked of  Bersi the Strong, one of his chieftains who stood near him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He knelt for a time before the  crucifix in silent prayer, and then, with his stout heart well prepared  for all that might happen to him, put on his finest armour and returned  to the deck.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He is no worthy king who  shuns his foes because of fear.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried with a loud voice  that could be clearly heard across the waters; and the men quickly  obeyed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He made his cast, and there were again two sixes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He feared  no foe, and was well aware that every craft had a trusty crew who were  fully able to look after their own safety.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He glanced round the bay at Olafs great  fleet, and thought of the reward that Sweyn had offered as the price of  his treachery.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He flattered him, praised his great wisdom, and, more than  all, spoke highly of his fleet and the surpassing splendour of the Long  Serpent.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was now one of the strongest war men in all Scandinavia,  and his fleet of battleships was equal to that of either Sweyn of  Denmark or Olaf of Sweden.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was in this belligerent mood when the rumour reached him that Olaf  Triggvison was at sea with his fleet, and was minded to make the voyage  to Wendland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He made only one exception to this rule.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  then sent messengers north and south along the land, bidding them  muster his forces.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he  cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He did not fear to come over here to  Norway and conquer this land; whereas you, with all your boasted glory  and your great ships, are so much afraid of my brother Sweyn that you  dare not venture into Denmark to get me what belongs to me, and of  which I have been shamefully robbed!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He found the queen in her hall weeping for her lost  estates.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had  on a newly wrought coat of chain mail, which was partly covered by a  mantle of fine crimson silk.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He wore his coarsest and oldest clothes; his thick, strong  arms were bared above the elbows, and his hardened hands were smutched  with tar and nail rust.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He strove to  introduce many of these laws into his own kingdom.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He also sent missions to the Orkney Islands, to the Shetlands, and the  Faroes, and even to so distant a country as Greenland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He sent priests into the lands of the Laps and  Fins.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He could not hope  that grownup people, who had all their lives been accustomed to worship  graven images, would all at once become fervent and devout Christians;  but he clearly saw the importance of bringing up all the children to a  full knowledge of the Christian faith, and accordingly he bade his  priests give constant care to the education of the young.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had succeeded in establishing Christianitynot very thoroughly, it  is true, for during the rest of his reign, and for long enough  afterwards, there was plenty of heathenism in Norway; but he did all  that he could to make men Christians, as far as he knew how himself,  and, by his own example of a pure and upright life, he did much to  deepen the feeling that, even in a social sense, the Christian  religion offered advantages which had never before been enjoyed in the  land.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He gained a ready favour with Sigrid by speaking all manner of  false and malicious scandal against the man whom she had so lately  rejected.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was on the point of setting out to woo her when he heard by  chance that King Olaf Triggvison was already bent upon a similar  journey.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried; thou withered  old heathen jade!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had heard that she was young, yet he now saw that her hair was  sprinkled with gray, that her eyes had lost the fire and fervour of  youth, and that her brow was wrinkled with age.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He wore no beard, but the hair was left  unshaven on his upper lip and it streamed down on either side of his  chin as fine as silk.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was to wed  with Gudrun upon the morrow, and this, he believed, was to be the crown  of his happiness.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He instituted monasteries throughout the  land, governed by bishops and abbots brought over from Rome and  Canterbury.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He then pointed to several of his  guests in turn, saying, You, Ligra of Middlehouse, shall be offered as  a sacrifice; and you, Kar of Griting; and you, Haldor of Skerding.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He said:    When we held Thing the last time, at Frosta, you will remember that I  demanded of the peasants that they should accept baptism; and they, on  the other hand, demanded that I should join them in sacrifice and make  blood offering, even as my kinsman King Hakon the Good had done.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was a  huge and cumbersome man with an iron gray beard, and as he stood by the  side of his horse his feet were seen to be covered with the mud of his  ploughed fields.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He baptized all those  regions and destroyed many heathen temples and established Christianity  far and wide.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had  laid waste many villages, and made human sacrifices to the pagan gods.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He said to his  bishop that all the old gods were no more and that Christ alone was  supreme.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He asked after the guest and bade his men call him; but  nowhere could the guest be found, nor had any man seen him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He looked round and  saw upon the threshold a very old man whose cloak was sprinkled with  snow.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He sat in his oaken chair  gazing into the glowing wood upon the hearth.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He called the town Nidaros, and it is to this day the  capital of Norway, although its name has been changed to Trondhjem, or  Drontheim.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He will look terrible and great to you, and fear will creep into your  breast if he comes to the gathering of our people.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He fought  many battles in England, and, for this reason perhaps, he is often  wrongly confused with his godfather, Olaf Triggvison.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was still in Viken when at the end of the winter Thangbrand returned  from England with a company of priests.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He said that he  intended to have the Christian faith set forth throughout all his  realm, and that he would bring about the christening of Norway or else  die in the endeavour.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was a man of very violent temper, and his  readiness to enter a quarrel and to draw his sword must have made him a  very singular exponent of the gospel of peace.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was greeted everywhere with enthusiastic homage.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He bade her go in among the trees, where the earl  was waiting.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was a low browed, evil looking man, with a bushy black beard and  long tangled hair.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had praised her beauty and declared that he loved her, and so she  loved him in return.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had only to make himself known  in order to secure the immediate allegiance and homage of the people.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He met with no opposition, for the people of the place were  then busy on their fields, and there was nothing unusual in the sight  of a few peaceful ships anchoring off their shores.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He questioned every man on board, but all swore by  the sign of the cross that they had seen nothing.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He turned quickly.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had in his company a certain  priest named Thangbrand, a mighty man who could wield the sword as well  as any viking, and whose voice was as the sound of thunder.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He took with him several Christian priests who had followed  him from England, and Thorir was in company with him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He is no king, but a wealthy man and of good kin, returned Thorir.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He well understood  the devotion of the Norse people to the family of Harald Fairhair, and  he now considered that his own safety could only be secured by the  death of this possible rival.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He believed that the adventurous Ole the Viking was none other than  Olaf Triggvison, nor could he doubt that this daring young rover would  sooner or later lay claim to the kingdom of Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He also levied a general tax upon all England to raise  the sum of sixteen thousand pounds as a bribe to the invaders to quit  the kingdom.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had made a  bold attempt to burn the town, but, like Olaf, he had been driven back  to his ships with great slaughter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  fought his way through them back to the city wall, where, through the  breach that had been made, his hosts were escaping on board the ships.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had depended upon Sweyn following him;  and had the Danish king been content to obey, London might indeed have  been taken by sheer strength.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He lay with his ships in the Orwell for three weeks, and at the end of  that time King Sweyn and his fleet arrived from the Baltic.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He believed that Odin would receive him there, and reward him  well for all the glorious deeds that he had done.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had once been a  bondslave among Norsemen, and had known Olafs father, King Triggvi,  whom Olaf personally resembled.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He harried also in the north parts of Ireland, and had  certain battles in the Island of Man.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  had harried wide on both shores of the Humber and in Northumberland,  had stormed King Idas fortress of Bamborough, and made a raid upon  Berwick.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He directed his left wing, under the command of Guthmund, upon  Brihtnoths right flank; his right wing, under Harald Biornson, wheeled  round to the attack of Brithnoths left.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He says that since it appears to be the common practice in this  country for kings and earls to buy off an unwelcome foe with offers of  gold, he will engage to withdraw and go back to his ships on your  paying him a sum of money that he will name.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had  arrayed his troops in a compact mass in the form of a wedge or  triangle, whose narrower point was opposite to the roadway of the  bridge.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  had already done great work in spreading the Christian faith among the  poor and ignorant people over whom he stood in authority, and his  beneficent gifts to the monasteries of Ely and Ramsey had won for him  the reputation almost of a saint.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He found that this was a good place to harbour his  fleet in for a time, so he remained in Ipswich until the blossom had  fallen from the trees.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He remained on board until nightfall, and then, dropping into a  small sailing boat that he had been careful to provide himself with, he  stole out of the bay and was soon far away among the skerries, safe  from all pursuit.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He did not  flinch, but tried to pass off his injury with a jest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he answered; and, seeing Earl  Hakon making ready for a renewed onslaught, he added: Now I will flee,  and all my men with me, for the battle is worse than when I spoke of it  before, and I will stand it no longer.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He fought whiles with his sword and  whiles with his battleaxe, and at times even with both weapons, one in  either hand, dealing many hard and heavy blows, and slaying many a man.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He encountered them  with four of his best longships against their two.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He went thither, accordingly,  but could do no more than set the wing in line again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He himself was not matched against any one, but  had to support the whole line and command it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had been placed in command of one of the largest dragonships, and  while the fleet was sailing round the islandhis own vessel being side  by side with that of Vagn Akisonhe went below and dressed himself in  his strongest armour, and took up his heavy battleaxe and the well  tempered sword that King Valdemar had given him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had seen  the giant mountains rising high into the sky, with their rugged summits  capped with snow and their lower slopes covered with vast forests of  tall pine trees.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He fared north to Mere, and there he fell in  with Earl Hakon, and told the earl tidings of a host that had come to  the land from Denmark.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He filled his drinking horn to the brim and held it high, while all  waited eagerly and silently to hear what vow he should make.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He learned,  too, something of what had been taking place in his native land since  the time of the death of King Triggvi.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was a very wealthy  monarch and held in high esteem throughout the countries of the Baltic,  and his court was the frequent meeting place of the great men of that  time.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had kept his favourite companions and his chosen  warriors on board his dragonship, so that they might ever be near him  in case of need.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He derided the comforts of a warm fireside and scorned the man  who should sleep under a sooty rafter or die on a bed of straw.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was  the swiftest and strongest swimmer in all Scandinavia, and at running  and climbing no man was his equal.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He shouted in great  fear for Olaf or his men to rescue him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He lay by Borgund holm for many weeks, with his tents ranged in order  along a stretch of the beach, and his ships drawn up to the high water  mark.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He rescued a  full score of helpless men from her decks, and stood by her until she  went down.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He saw that his men were already eagerly preparing for a  fight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He measured with his eye the space between each  of the twenty blades.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  was of an age with Olaf Triggvison, and so much did the two resemble  one the other that, when apart, they were often taken to be brothers.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He made his friend Egbert the  sailing master, while one Kolbiorn Stallare became his masterofarms.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He now owed no allegiance to any man,  but was free to journey where he pleased, a king upon his own decks.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried as he came near.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He must learn, too, how to defend himself, and how, if  wounded, to bear pain without shrinking.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had sold her,  he said, to a stranger, who had taken her on board his ship and carried  her away across the seas.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He told very truthfully how the  young prisoner had made his attack upon Klerkon, and showed that it was  in no mean and underhand way that he had committed this crime, but with  such boldness that none had guessed what was happening until they saw  Klerkon fall to the ground with the lads axe buried deep in his skull.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had killed Jarl  Klerkon, and the sense of his own guilt now preyed upon him like a  terrible nightmare.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He made his abode in the town of York, and  he warded the country well, for full oft did the Danes and Northmen  harry there in the earlier time.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He fared westward to the Orkneys, and got  many vikings to join him, then he sailed south and harried all about  the north parts of England.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was now a full grown man  and a valiant warrior.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He sailed west over sea to Scotland, and  there harried the coasts; and then to the Orkneys, where he had many  battles with the vikings of the isles.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He felt that  the queens interest in his nephew was now secure and that it boded  well for Olaf.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  stooped to treachery, and even to murder.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He made new laws, took from  the peasants their odal estates, and declared all land to be the kings  property.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was fond of manly sports, and his skill and  beauty brought him the favour and admiration of all men of the  northland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He thought that it would go very ill with  himself if Olafs kingly birth should be known.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He recalled what he had seen on the viking ship years  before.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he went on.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He broke off, listening to the furious cries of the crowd outside.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He tried to take me.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He saw that something ill had happened.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He could be trusted in all things.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had been recognizedas how  would one so distinguished from all other youths fail to be?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was not personally  afraid of Klerkon, neither did he believe that the viking would go to  much trouble to secure his prize even if his horse should be  successful.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He shall be hindered by me, returned Thorgils.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he repeated slowly.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"knew"},{"sentence":"He will return to  his native land while yet he is in the flower of his age, and he will  reign with great glory in this northern part of the world.","nextSentStartsWith":"so"},{"sentence":"He stammered for an instant, and then, feeling  the dogs head against his hand, he caught the animals ear between his  fingers and gave it a hard, firm pinch.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"He saw her doubt and made  a sign to Olaf to draw nearer.","nextSentStartsWith":"nay,"},{"sentence":"He is quick witted and very clever at all games, and that  is why it pleases me to teach him many things.","nextSentStartsWith":"yet"},{"sentence":"He was a very wise and powerful ruler, and his subjects were  prosperous and peaceable, having many useful arts, and carrying on a  commerce with the great city of Mikligard.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"He is but a  child, and would only be a burden to us.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"He spoke kindly to me, explained Olaf, and I could not refuse to  answer him when he asked me how I came to be a bond slave.","nextSentStartsWith":"threefourseveneight!"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"for"},{"sentence":"He watched Olaf springing on the ponys  back, and saw the men securing the boy with ropes.","nextSentStartsWith":"erik"},{"sentence":"He was dressing himselfalbeit with great trouble, for the things were  strange to him who had hitherto worn naught but a poor slaves  kirtlewhen a shrill horn was sounded from without.","nextSentStartsWith":"in"},{"sentence":"He took off from his own shoulders a riding cloak of scarlet cloth and  added, Take this cloak and wear it.","nextSentStartsWith":"seventyone"},{"sentence":"He looked into the mans face and saw only kindness  there, and yet there was something very suspicious in the strangers  eagerness to possess him.","nextSentStartsWith":"she"},{"sentence":"He can run for half a day  without being wearied.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"He glanced, too, at the mans great  sword and his cloak of rich blue cloth, and guessed rightly that he was  of noble rank.","nextSentStartsWith":"queen"},{"sentence":"He was dropping pebbles from his  full hand into the water, to give movement to the tiny boats.","nextSentStartsWith":"in"},{"sentence":"He has in him the makings of a good  war man.","nextSentStartsWith":"her"},{"sentence":"He turned and saw at his side  the tall red bearded viking chief, whose broken nose and coarse scarred  face were now shielded from the suns rays by a wide hat made of dry  reeds.","nextSentStartsWith":"but"},{"sentence":"He stood with his bare feet firmly  gripping the plank, and his head thrown back, and his lithe, well  balanced body swaying in regular movement with his arms.","nextSentStartsWith":"do"},{"sentence":"He ran his fingers over his short yellow hair,  and then, turning with his back to the sun, flung one of his knives  high up into the air.","nextSentStartsWith":"now,"},{"sentence":"He was fair of skin, and by this Sigurd knew that he  was not an Esthonian.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"He rode across the marketplace and there alighted from his horse, and  turned his eyes towards the sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"my"},{"sentence":"He was a very handsome man, tall and strong, with long fair hair and  clear blue eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He strode  nearer to them, and heard the hoarse voices of the vikings calling out  in loud praise of a feat that had been performed by someone in their  midst.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"He was a  tall, red bearded man, whose nose was flat against his scarred, bronzed  face.","nextSentStartsWith":"now,"},{"sentence":"he asked of the tall youth at his side.","nextSentStartsWith":"then"},{"sentence":"He looked among the crowd of boys that  still loitered near the ship, and addedWhere has the youngster gone  who stood just now upon the plank?","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"He is the thrall  of goodman Reas, over in Rathsdalea mornings walk from here.","nextSentStartsWith":"two"},{"sentence":"he echoed in surprise.","nextSentStartsWith":"asked"},{"sentence":"He never departed from her,  but always helped her and defended her wheresoever she went.","nextSentStartsWith":"in"},{"sentence":"He raised his  eyes, and beheld the faces of two men, who looked down upon him from  over the barrier of the pig sty.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"He can climb the highest pine tree in  Rathsdaleas he did last seed time to harry a bluejays nest; and no  seamew can swim more lightly on the water.","nextSentStartsWith":"do"},{"sentence":"he said firmly, and he made a rapid movement to leap  over the barrier; but he forgot the wound in his arm, and the pain of  it made him so awkward that Reas caught him by his wrists and held him  there until Sigurd, springing from his horse, came and put an iron  chain round the lads neck.","nextSentStartsWith":"so"},{"sentence":"He looked upon handshaking as a  most solemn covenant, only to be made when great matters were at stake.","nextSentStartsWith":"for"},{"sentence":"He  answered promptly:    No, I will not take your hand.","nextSentStartsWith":"on"},{"sentence":"He looked at the other end of it, and saw it was  so fastened that he might easily undo it.","nextSentStartsWith":"king"},{"sentence":"He was silent for  many minutes, then, laying his hand on the strangers arm, he asked:    What name have you?","nextSentStartsWith":"lit"},{"sentence":"He was born, he said, in Northumberland.","nextSentStartsWith":"what"},{"sentence":"he cried in alarm.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"He drew Olaf nearer to him and put his arm about his neck.","nextSentStartsWith":"my"},{"sentence":"He silently put his hand into Sigurds great palm, and let  himself be led back to the place where Thorgils

fame.","nextSentStartsWith":"helgi,"},{"sentence":"He is a great viking, answered Sigurd.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he answered.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He spoke to the lad very gravely, and,  telling him of the vikings recognition, cautioned him against  appearing again within the circle of the course.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was meant by his  nature for the sea, and I think that he will some day prove to be a  very great warrior.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was thinking that Olaf had become strangely restless  and unruly of late.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was strangely agitated.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He only bent down and took a  handful of rushes up from the floor, and began to quietly clean the  blade of his axe that he held under his arm.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He slew him cruelly  and in cold blood, and for no other reason than that poor Thoralf was  old and infirm.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He told the king how Klerkon,  standing within the gate, had been attacked by young Ole of the golden  hair, and how without word or warning the boy had suddenly raised his  axe and driven it into Klerkons head, so that the blade stood right  down into the brain of him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He became a terror to all  peaceful folk, and for his murderous deeds by sea and land he won the  name of Erik Bloodaxe.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had succeeded in uniting all Norway into one nation,  and this was good.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He therefore  created all his sons kings, and gave to each his portion of the  country, on condition that after his own death they should all  acknowledge Erik Bloodaxe their overlord.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He first killed his brother,  Ragnvald Rattlebone, because he was said to be a sorcerer.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He led his son  Erik to his royal high seat and put him there as the king, so that  Gunnhild by this became the queen, and could work her evil as she  willed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had made himself the king of all Norway, even as his  father had been.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He thereupon took a ship  and roamed about as a viking.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was forced to abandon his ships and save himself by  flight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He told how Queen Astrid, leaving her two daughters at Ofrestead, had  fared east away into Sweden, and of what privations she had borne for  her sons sake, and of how, still pursued by her enemies, she had at  length taken safe refuge with Hakon Gamle, a friend of her fathers.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had known all along of his descent from King  Harald Fairhair, but not until now did he fully and clearly understand  that by the death of his father and of all his fathers brothers he was  himself at this moment the sole heir to the throne of Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He wondered by what means they would take his life.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He knew that Sigurd had made no idle  offer when he had said that he would give up his life for his sake; but  Sigurd was guiltless, and it would be a cowards act to allow him to  make this sacrifice.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He looked about him fearlessly at the crowd of  townsfolk and vikings, who were there, as he now well knew, to bear  witness against him and to hear him condemned.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was  named Rand the Strong, and the vikings had chosen him as their captain  in the place of the dead Jarl Klerkon.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He saw  her lean over and whisper in the kings ear.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He is guilty,  and must suffer the penalty of his crime.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He will, therefore, pay to the vikings whom he  has injured the sum of two hundred gold marks.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was twelve winters old when he  came into Holmgard, and he abode in King Valdemars service other five  winters.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had seen the  ships passing along the rocky coasts of Esthonia; he had breathed the  fresh free air of the sea, and the viking blood in him had been roused.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was a kings son, and to be  worthy of his father it was well that he should excel even the full  grown men who had been well tried in battle and who had never known the  meaning of defeat.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He could ride the wildest horse in the kings stable.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He lacked not faith in his own  personal prowess, for that had many times been amply proved in the  games and exercises that he had daily engaged in, nor did his courage  fail him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He watched the  setting of the sails and asked many questions concerning them, until he  could understand why at any time a certain rope was hauled or loosened,  and why when the wind blew strong a reef was taken in.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He sustained a  great company of menatarms at his own cost from the wealth that he  had inherited from his Uncle Sigurd, and from such riches as the king  bestowed upon him; and the leading of this host throve so well in his  hands that all the younger men of the realm flocked to his side, eager  to be enlisted in his service.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had a score or so of  bearded berserks on each of his shipsmen who feared neither fire nor  steel, but who gloried in warfare, and loved nothing better than to be  in the midst of a great battle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He bent his course across the Gulf of Finland, and  then westward among the many green islands and rocky holms that lie in  the mid sea between Finland and Sweden, and for many sunny days and  calm starry nights simply enjoyed the idle pleasures of his new life of  freedom.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He wanted to move back a knight which he had exposed,  but Kolbiorn would not allow it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He then turned to descend with the man under  his arm and laid him unharmed on the ground.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was kind  and lowly hearted, bountiful of gifts, very glorious of attire, and  before all men for high heart in battle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was a  very mighty man, and his wealth and personal prowess were such that  Burislafs daughter Astrid encouraged his wooing of her with the result  that they were wedded.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had come into Wendland in the company of his friend  Sigvaldi, for they had both been awarring together, and, being beaten  in a great sea fight, they had taken refuge in the court of Burislaf.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had garrisoned  the place with vikings on the condition that they should defend the  land, and be always ready to support him in any warlike expedition.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was accounted the most  favoured by the gods among all the vikings of Jomsburg, and his renown  spread far and wide.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He first  proposed the memory of his dead father, and before raising the drink to  his lips added this oath:    I swear, said he, that before three winters are worn away I will  sail over to Norway and slay Earl Hakon, or else drive him from the  land.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He now thought  over what other vow he could make in its stead.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  determined to fight boldly and fearlessly in this coming battle, so  that he might thus win his way nearer to the possession of his  birthright and the goal of his growing ambitions.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He turned away his ship, shouting to Vagn and Bui, whose ships were now  close to his own, to follow in all haste.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He took up two chests of gold, one  in either arm, and mounting the gunwale of his ship, cried out:  Overboard all folk of Bui!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was  seized from behind, disarmed, and bound hand and foot with strong  ropes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He did not doubt that, because they were all that  remained of the Jomsburgers, they were therefore the bravest and  stoutest of all the vikings who had engaged in the great battle, and he  feared that if they were allowed to live they would surely bring some  great trouble upon him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He put Vagn Akison at the end of the log, intending to keep  him to the last in order to increase his agony.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He offers it who has the powerEarl Erik himself, answered the earl.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He quickly  guessed the reason, and, instead of attempting to win over his former  friends, he had his sail set to the wind and sped out westward across  the sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was  sound asleep.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He looked very noble and beautiful, and all  the shipmen stared at him in amazement.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He has sailed west over the sea towards the Orkneys.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He chanced to look across the water in the  direction of the setting sun, and far away on the line of the horizon  he espied a ridge of white cliffs.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He pillaged the houses and churches, and  having emptied them of all that was worth taking he carried off the  booty to his ships.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was at this time Earldorman of East Anglia.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He assembled a goodly army of  soldiers, both archers and swordmen, and marched towards the coast.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He led his ships inward on the top of the tide.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was about to return when he saw that Olaf was  sending Guthmund down to him with some message, and he waited.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he demanded.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was  closely followed by a large number of the vikings.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He carried his heavy battleaxe;  but before he could raise his weapon to strike, the nearest of the  defenders stepped unexpectedly forward and dealt him a tremendous blow  which made him stagger backward.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had seen that the tide  in the creek was ebbing, and that very soon the bridge would cease to  be an important post.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He reserved for himself the  position which was considered the most difficult to deal withthe  point where the English chief himself stood, surrounded by his  strongest and most experienced soldiers.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He allowed  the East Anglians to carry off their dead and give them Christian  burial.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He lay with his ships off Maldon during the rest of the summer, and  raided in Essex and Suffolk without hindrance.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had already discovered  that his forces were too small to attempt, with any certainty of  success, a deliberate conquest of England; and, indeed, even before the  arrival of Ethelreds messengers, he had determined to presently  withdraw his fleet until such times as he had gathered about him a host  large enough and strong enough to lay siege to London.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He greeted Olaf most kindly, and when they had spoken  together for a while, Olaf asked him what he could say as to how he  should speed coming by his rightful inheritance or any other good  fortune.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He could speak very well in the Norse  tongue, and his soft and gentle voice was very soothing to all who  heard it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  lay among the Scilly Isles for many days thereafter, and learned the  true faith so well that it remained his guiding light throughout the  rest of his life, and made him, as shall presently be seen, one of the  most zealous Christians of his time.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was not yet so entirely a  Christian that he had any scruples in attacking Christian folk and  turning them out of their homes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He led his procession of battleships up the Thames.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He lost many men in the attempt, but at  last a breach was made, and at the head of many hundreds of desperate  warriors he entered the city.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He now declared that he was willing to become entirely a  Christian, and to set aside his belief in the old gods of Scandinavia.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had a great axe, and  when Alfwin attacked him with his sword, he quickly overpowered him,  and then bound him fast with ropes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He glanced across to where his friend Kolbiorn Stallare was standing.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He led his host of vikings, with  I know not how many battleships, against Earl Hakon; but he was  defeated with great slaughter and took to flight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He sailed first  to the South Isles, and thence up north into the Pentland Firth.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He also knew that its point was poisoned.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He searched among the shadows of the bulwarks and down among the  rowers benches, but saw no trace of his secret enemy.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had  intentionally deceived Olaf Triggvison by representing that the earl  might easily be overthrown and his subjects as easily won over to the  side of a new king.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had not gone very far when, from behind a  rocky headland, three vessels of war appeared upon the blue water,  rowing out to meet him, with their red battle shields displayed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He looked about him in fear.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He looked round in renewed fear.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He declared in a loud voice that he would  give a great reward and speedy furtherance to the man who should find  Earl Hakon and bring him to his death.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He spoke to me, and I thought that he laid a gold  necklace about my neck.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He resolved to stand firm against all  opposition, and if gentle persuasion should not avail he would have no  scruple in employing physical force.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was, however, wise enough to recognize that in order to succeed in  his mission it was necessary for him first to make his own position as  monarch perfectly secure and unassailable.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He fell into a drunken brawl with a  certain viking, who challenged him to fight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He is known in history by the title of Olaf the Saint, and  he is to this day regarded as the patron saint of Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he added, pointing to the rising sun.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He built a  town on the bank of the river Nid, and a great hall for himself up  above Ship Creek.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He blasphemed so much that Olaf became wrothful and  said that Rand should die the worst of deaths.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  therefore sent his messengers through all the lands bordering on  Thrandheim fiord summoning a great meeting of the bonders at a place  named Frosta.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He watched the bonders preparing the pyre  for the sacrifice, but before it was lighted he went into the inner  chamber and inspected the images of the gods.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was in a chariot of gold, into which were harnessed  a pair of goats made of wood and silver.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He is the most  celebrated of all gods, saving only Odin.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  saw a white arm upraised; he saw the gleaming dagger poised over his  masters breast.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  gazed into her pale and terror stricken face.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He is dead as the stones  in the street.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He encouraged fisheries and  husbandry and handicrafts, and men who had given up their lives to  warfare and vikingry now occupied themselves with useful arts and  industries.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He set sail with this fleet in the early days  of the summer, and Queen Thyra went with him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He arrived off the Wendish coast without being in any way molested, and  he anchored his fleet in the great bay of Stetten haven.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He found King Olaf sitting at his ease against  the rail, carving runes upon the lid of a wooden box that he had made  for the holding of the queens jewels.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He marvelled how Olaf  had come to hear this news, and he feared also that his own schemes  might end in failure.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He resolved to abide by the earls advice in all  things.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He stood in  dumb amazement as the towering prow of the Long Serpent glided into  view, shooting long beams of golden light across the sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He heard a hoarse croak, and knew it to  be the croak of a raven.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He turned to his mariners.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  brought his vessels to a halt, but it was not from hesitation.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had  seen from the first that it would be his place to assume the defensive,  and he had given the order for his ships to be drawn up in line,  broadside to broadside.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He is the noblest champion who will fight against us today, said  Olaf, and from him and the high born men that I see upon his decks we  may expect a hard battle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He called out  loudly to Ketil the Tall:    Bring forward the large ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He laid an arrow on the string and  turned it on Wolf, who cried:    Shoot another way, king, and not at me but at your foes, for what I  win in the fight I win for Norway, and maybe you will find that you  have not over many men before the evening comes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He assailed each ship as it  approached with showers of well directed arrows.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He now rowed proudly upon  the left wing of the Norse fleet.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He thought that he had made an end of the King of Sweden.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had  won no fame by his daring attack, but only ignominious defeat, and he  was fain to escape alive, albeit very badly wounded.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had also seen  Sweyn Forkbeard in the thick of battle, and Olaf of Sweden no less.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had a firm belief that the men of  Norway were braver and bolder, stronger in body, more skilful in the  use of their weapons, and had greater powers of endurance than any of  their neighbours.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He at least  saw cause for thinking that the only men who could succeed in  vanquishing King Olafs Norsemen were the Norsemen of Earl Erik  Hakonson.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He saw that  while the Long Serpent continued to be supported on either side by five  strong and well manned dragonships she was practically unassailable.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He knew how much depended upon  his preventing Erik from boarding the kings ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was himself unwounded still,  but his silken tunic was tattered, so that the links of his coat of  mail showed through.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He saw that his stem  defenders were quickly becoming fewer and fewer, and that those who yet  remained wielded their weapons with slow and heavy strokes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He saw that his stem defenders, to whom he had served new  weapons, had now become so furious that they leapt upon the gunwales in  order to reach their foes with their swords and kill them.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He drew his bow.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was tall and powerfully framed,  and bore his years and the white volume of his beard in an  altogether stately fashion; but his eyes were most indelible, pale  blue and singularly cold in repose, very bright and keen and  searching when his face was animated.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was a venerable figure, conspicuous by his long, wintry locks  and embroidered cloak of blue, straight as a spearshaft, but  grown too old for warfare.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He looked round, and saw the same  old man who had accosted Ketill coming down the pier after him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried; I have come far to see thee.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had a  reckless, merry look on his handsome face, and bore himself as  though he was aware of his personal attractions.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he asked, more as if he were in  jest than in earnest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was  the only surviving son of the King of Sogn.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He felt a friendly hand dragging him to the side, and heard  Helgis voice saying,    Art thou able to swim for it?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He scanned the sound narrowly, and in all its long stretch there  was not a sign of friend or foe.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He asked her name, and she told him it was Osla, daughter of a  Norse leader who had fought in the Irish seas, and had finally  settled in Ireland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He is  wounded, I fear, and certainly he is both wet and hungry.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He knew the face, he had heard the voice of old, but in  the kaleidoscope of memory he could see no name to fit them, no  incident wherewith they might be linked.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He walked for some miles  through moorland ground, and paused at length on the top of a  range of hills, whence he had a wide view over the inland country.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had landed, he thought, on the Holy Isle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He looked round as though he expected to see a cloaked figure  start up out of the gloaming, but the island was deserted and  still.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He paused, and a tongue of flame shot suddenly from the fire and  cast a bright light in the cell.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried suddenly, you know of  the burning?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He paused for a moment, and then went on in the same strain of  high excitement,    Now you know me.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He paced the turf with hurried steps.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had sworn to  let slip no chance of taking vengeance on the burners of his  brother.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he demanded.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He took her hands.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he said again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  looked at Estein, and smiled.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He talks of the gods, he said to himself.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he asked; shall we run for some distant bay,  and return tomorrow night?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He longed, too, for  action, and the idea, once held, fascinated him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he asked, and that question left no room for the  proud Viking to hesitate.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He left the poop with his horn, and Estein seated himself on a  stool, and leaning back against the bulwarks, tried to rest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He told me a tale of a burning.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He made as little  impression, however, as Estein, and then by mutual consent both  men stopped for a minutes breathingspace.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  rained in his blows like a hailstorm; but fast though they came,  he was sparing his strength, and there was less vigour in his  attack than there seemed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He wins, Ketill!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He never once alluded to their guest, never even  apparently observed his departure, and in her heart his daughter  thanked him for his silence.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He has been gone these eight  months.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he repeated.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He sang last night.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He sat  continually in his cell; and though Osla would not acknowledge her  fears even to herself, she knew that death could not be far away.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He took her hand as he spoke, and she tried to stifle a sob.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He has been single too long.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He would sing, jest, and quarrel; but his jests were often bitter,  and his quarrels gave rise to more talk than his gloom, for before  he had been of an even and generous temper.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He stood listlessly at the  back, apparently hardly hearing what was going on, his thoughts  returning despite himself to their melancholy groove.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He turned sharply to the man and asked,    How came you by this?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He racked his  brains, but he could think of no one in that remote country who  would be likely to send such a message.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He turned to Helgi and said,    No fighting will there be, Helgi; but I have known you welcome  even a feast.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was aroused by hearing the voices of Helgi and Thorar come back  to him clear and cheerfully.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He thinks himself  old, and never gives maids a thought at all.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He could only resolve to warn his men, and,  so far as he could, keep them together and near him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he whispered.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He glanced sharply at Estein; but  the Viking, looking him full in the face, laughed noisily and  cried,    Helgis head seems hardly so strong as his hand, Thorar!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He knew that if he could once get rid of him, he had little to  fear from any of the others; and as he thought hard for a plan,  the king, who had for some time been fast asleep, suddenly solved  the difficulty.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He saw only that the man was small, and wrapped in a  cloak of fur; his sword flashed, and he was almost in the act of  striking when the figure held up a hand and stopped.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He turned as he spoke, and looking over his shoulder to see that  Estein followed him, started for the stockade.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He said not  a word, but, with a swinging stride, hastened down the glade,  Estein close at his shoulder.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He replied, either not noticing or disregarding the dryness of  Esteins retort,    I knew well, Estein, thou wouldst come.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He glanced contemptuously at the sleeping figure on the floor.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he added, a little dubiously.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He too spoke to me, and every time the purport of the  message was the same.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He showed the Viking to a pallet bed in the loft, where, worn out  with fatigue and anxiety, he quickly fell asleep.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He found Atli in the room below.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He smiled as he glanced at  his garb: the long wolfskin coat reached almost to his knees,  over his legs he had drawn thickknitted hose to keep out the  cold, his helmet was hidden by the furry cap, and the only part of  his original equipment to be seen were the sword girt round his  waist and the long shield that hung upon his back.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He only knew that he had wandered for some  time, when a prospect of white, open country began to show in  peeps through the trees ahead.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had only  time to see that more villagers were coming out of the houses, and  that the girl had turned away to join the other woman, when his  wits came back to him, and turning into the path he set off as  fast as he could put his feet to the ground.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had lost all idea of  where he was, and the sun had already set, when more by good luck  than by good guidance, the trees grew thinner in front, and he  found himself once more in the glade of the stream.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He  could hear the stream rumbling over the stones, but not another  sound.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He could see his foe move to one side, and heard his arrow  strike a branch.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He smiled to himself again, and thought, Never, surely, has that  bowman shot at so stout a garment.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He raised  it high, and driving the point hard into the ground, dropped on  one knee behind it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He soon tired of waiting, however, and  presently an arrow, aimed evidently at what he could see of  Esteins legs, passed within six inches of one knee and buried  itself in the snow beside him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He rose almost to his full height, fired his arrow, and quickly  stooped again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he gasped.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He looked upon me like a startled  cow, and said, You are a cursed Norseman.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He liked not the  job over much, yet he dared not refuse, and so we started.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He had made up his mind that the  resemblance must have been the work of fancy, yet as soon as they  had reached the house of Atli, he took the old man aside, and  asked him,    Shall I then sail when the snows have melted?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He gathered them over him again,  and then lay for a few minutes listening to the rising wind.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was just dropping off to sleep again, when his attention  was startled into wakefulness by a knock at the outer door.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He listened keenly and,  with a sensible feeling of disappointment, heard the door close,  the noise cease, and Jomars steps quietly cross the floor again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He thought he caught Atlis tones  answering his sullen servant, and presently he heard two men come  out and go to the outer door.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He saw the change,  and quickly added,    To be quite honest with you, I knew not indeed that you were  here, and feeling cold I came down to warm me.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he asked.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"he cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He raised his sword as he spoke; but

something.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He died penitent, King Estein, said Osla.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"He was then alive, she answered; for the writing further told  me what I knew not before, that I had an uncle still alive, or  rather whom my father thought was still alive, and first of all I  had to seek

Estein.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was silence for a moment, but apparently they  suspected nothing, for the whispered talk went on again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There he  lay, and smiled to himself at the prospect below.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There I stood, stamping my feet and beating my arms upon my breast  to keep the cold away, till I began to think that something was  amiss.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was no need  to rise before, or I should have roused thee.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a time when he who had just saved thy  life would have had fairer thanks than this.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is  little time for words now.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There are barely a score  of them.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There are men in the town!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is work ahead for some of our young blades.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is no cure for spells like a pair of bright

men.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was another brief silence, and then loudly and clearly he  cried,    Bring up my banner!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is no one here but me, father.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There are many such about the Orkneys; one I know well, which  methinks we should reach soon after sunrise.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There were  no words; the others closed up and loosened their daggers in their  sheaths.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is witchcraft here, they said; and Ketill was as obstinate  as the rest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There they deliberated  for long.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There

not one.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There he sat down and mused for long.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There his daughter was born and passed her  early girlhood; and

remains but me, said Estein at length.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There  shall come a change in thee that I cannot fathom.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was still a most fierce fight going on between the earls men and  Olafs champions.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was no lack of arrows on the Short Serpent, or indeed, on any  other of King Olafs battleships.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There were seventy war galleys in all, and each vessel was well manned  and fully prepared for battle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was yet much to be done before she would be ready for sea; but  such work as the stepping of her two masts, fitting her standing  rigging, caulking her deck planks, fashioning her cabins, and adorning  her prow and stern could best be done when she was afloat.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a frown upon his brow and a look of mistrust in his eyes; for  he guessed that the coming of this woman was some guileful trick of her  brother Sweyn, whom he knew to be an enemy of his own.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There sat the figure of  Thor, chief among all, with his hammer in his hand and gold and silver  rings about him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is but one place where I deem that King Olaf will not think of  seeking for such a man as you, she said; and that is in the ditch  under the pig

him to be dead.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was all  her wealth for Olaf to enjoy if he had so wished, and he might even  have become the king in Dublin.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was no need to tell me, returned Thorir.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a new  light in his eyes, and his cheeks were flushed, and when he spoke there  was a tremor in his voice that showed how deeply this news of his long  lost mother had affected him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is one at your back who seems not less strong than I.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is much that is unusual about you, lord, answered Thorir; and  little marvel is there that I should look

it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There were other troubles, too.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a very fine harbour or dock made within the Burgh, in which  three hundred longships could lie at the same time, all being locked  within the strongly built walls of granite with their massive gates of  iron.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was no need for them to make ready their weapons, for  these had been kept well prepared ever since the beginning of the  cruise, and there was nothing further to be done than to bring the  arrows up on deck and serve them round among the bowmen, twenty arrows  to each mans quiver; and as for swords, spears, and armour, every man  on board knew well where to put his hand on his own.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There he remained for two other years, enjoying great favour  in the court and performing many important services.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a loud crackling of dry twigs and the flames rose amid a  cloud of black smoke, showing Olaf standing at the stern with the  tiller in his hand.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a sharp hand  to hand fight, in which many were killed on both sides; but at last the  islanders gave way before the invaders and Olaf got the victory.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is little cause for envy, returned Egbert.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a brief fight, in which I know not how  many men were slain or wounded, and in the end the islanders got the  victory.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was one matter which had sorely troubled him for many a long day,  and this was the thought of his mother living in bondage.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There sat King Valdemar in his robes of justice, and  with his naked sword lying before him on the oaken table.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There on that island her son was born, and  she had him sprinkled with water and named Olaf, after his fathers  father.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There she was well received by the  Danish king, Harald Bluetooth.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a great battle, and many of the English  folk were killed; but ere the day was ended Erik lay dead upon the  field, and that was the last of him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is but one hope left, and  in that hope lies my own despair and my own undoing.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There you will be safe from all discovery until after the  vikings have departed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was one,  however, who saw better than he, and this was Queen Allogia.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There has come into Holmgard a man whom I  met many months ago.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"There they  remained until the early summer, when they brought over their flocks  and herds for the sheep

burned.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"There was only a narrow horse  track to guide them, and soon even this was lost in the rank herbage,  and the land became a wild desolate waste without sign of human  dwelling, but only the bare rugged hills, with here and there a thread  of water streaming down them into the lower land.","nextSentStartsWith":"olafs"},{"sentence":"There were  many

could do with him; so I sold him to a dalesman named Reas, who gave me  a very fine rain cloak for him; nor do I rue my bargain, for the cloak  is still in use and the lad is scarcely of the value of his food and  shelter.","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"There is  little peace in the land, for the kings are for ever quarrelling over  their jointures; but it seems that Harald Greyfell is having the upper  hand over his brothers.","nextSentStartsWith":"all"},{"sentence":"There was a smile upon his lips, and his eyes were  tender and kindly, winning confidence.","nextSentStartsWith":"no"},{"sentence":"There was a frown on  his brow, and his blue eyes flashed in quick anger.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"There is little cause to fear such a thing, said Thorgils.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"There are none but our two  selves in all Esthonia who know that you are Olaf Triggvison, and this  man could not by any means

be  trusted.","nextSentStartsWith":"thorkel,"},{"sentence":"There the man stood over him, watching him as he dreamed his  childish dreams.","nextSentStartsWith":"methinks"},{"sentence":"There was a look of doubt in Allogias eyes, as though she knew that  the steward was telling her but a half truth.","nextSentStartsWith":"chapter"},{"sentence":"There lived at that time in Valders a maid named Gyda, continued  Sigurd.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was but one son among them who was  wise enough to enjoy his share in contentment and keep peace.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is but little more to tell, returned Sigurd, looking up with  anxious eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There Sigurd landed, meaning to gather taxes and tribute from the  people.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is trouble among the people over in the Isle  of Dago.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There were in his own ship  four score of rowing mentwo at each oarand as he watched them he  marvelled how they could endure the hard labour without breaking their  backs or tearing out their arms; and to prove to himself what amount of  strength the work required he went down into the ships waist and,  taking off his shirt of chain mail, took his turn upon one of the  benches, thus winning the praise of all on board.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is one, said Kolbiorn, that I would be glad to see you  attempt, although there is danger in it, and I may be doing wrong in  suggesting it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There  he was met by one of his shipmates, who called out in an excited voice  that there was a large viking ship in sight, and that she was bearing  down towards them as though to give battle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There he got good haven and, faring full  peacefully, abode there throughout the winter months.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There he divided his forces,  leaving twenty of Olaf Triggvisons longships in the firth, so that  they might perchance intercept Earl Hakon should he escape the main  fleet.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was then a pause in the battle, and it was seen that Earl Hakons  ship had been taken landward, out of reach of the Jomsvikings arrows.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There he exchanged his tattered armour for a good  suit of seamans clothes, with a large cloak, a sword, and a bag of  gold.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There were many wounded men on board the ships, and, while Olaf was  still lying in Lyme Firth, some of them died; others, whose limbs were  lamed and who were no longer able to work at the oars or to engage in  battle, were left behind in Jutland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There he harried along the coasts and got a  good store of cattle and corn, and won many men and two other ships to  his following.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was pure water to be got in abundance from the  higher parts of the river, while fish could be got near hand from out  the sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a strong and well disciplined navy to protect the coasts, and  all intending invaders were held in defiance.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There were brave men in that  part of the country, however, who, at the first alarm of the landing of  the Norsemen, made themselves ready to defend their homes and the homes  of their neighbours.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There Kolbiorn lay for a long while, and Olaf  Triggvison, who had seen him fall, believed him to be dead.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There again he harried wide  about, and also in Cornwall, and at length he came to the Scilly Isles.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There were many reasons urging him to this journey.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There he abode throughout  the winter among his own kindred as well as many who had been great  friends with his father.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There comes the messenger of our God, bringing light and  warmth into the world!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was one among the bonders named Skeggi Ironbeard, a very rich  farmer who cared little for king or earls, but loved only the freedom  of his farm, his ale at night, and the warmth of his fireside.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There had been two most fruitful  seasons, with good crops, and the country was rich.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a large forecastle in  which the warriors slept and took their meals, and abaft the main mast  there was another cabin called the foreroom, in which King Olaf had  his high seat, or throne.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a strong breeze blowing and the  sea was rough.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was still great  hope of his scheme succeeding.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There are yet two sixes on the dice, said he, and it is easy for the  gods to let them turn up again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was no sign of haste on board of any one of the ships, for all  men knew that there was a long days fight before them, and that it was  well to make all their preparations with slow caution.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There are now but six, was the answer.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There Estein Hakonson must feed the wolves.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is little time for talking now, son of Hakon!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There died a brave man!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a wild and furious rush of men towards the poop.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a rush to the bulwarks, a splashing of bodies in the  water, and then the doomed and deserted ships, the attacker and  the attacked, sank in the turmoil of the tide.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is a great roost here  when the tide is running.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There are no other gods.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There  followed a consultation in low tones, and then one man left the  boat and came up the bank.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There he stopped and pointed to a door.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There I shall take  you.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is no need to remind me of that.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There are fair maids in the south lands, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There is a writing.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a moments angry  silence, and then the king glanced round the host of weatherbeaten  Vikings and highborn chiefs and cried,    Who will punish these cowardly rebels of mine?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was a laugh at Ketills words, for his person had never been  noted for its spareness.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was not likely  to be hard fighting; for small as Esteins force was, the natives  were badly armed and little esteemed as warriors.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There was only room for them to walk in single file, and  it took him some trouble to keep up.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There spoke the brother of Olaf, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There seemed to be a dispute about something which the  whole party were engrossed in, when suddenly one man gave a cry  and pointed at Estein.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There I  found a sentinel who, it seemed, had lately been sharing in the  hospitality of King Bue.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There will be one less Jemtlander tonight,  I said, as I laid an arrow on my bow.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"There followed a parley

hostages.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Before this time he had had no experience in the working of a ship; so  in the early part of the voyage he gave his mind to the learning of all  matters wherein he knew himself to be most ignorant.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Before him stretched the rippling,  sunlit bay with its wooded holms.","nextSentStartsWith":"and"},{"sentence":"Before he could  do more, however, there was the sound of horses feet outside.","nextSentStartsWith":"nevertheless"},{"sentence":"Before the time of his crossing to  the Orkneys he had lost five of his ships and a large number of his  men, and from this it may be judged that he had either encountered very  stormy weather or suffered some reverse at the hands of his enemies.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Before Earl Erik  could understand, a javelin whizzed past his left ear and buried its  point in the bulwark behind him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Before them stood his  son Estein, a tall, auburnhaired, brighteyed young man, gaily  dressed, after the fashion of the times, in red kirtle and cloak,  and armed as yet only with a gilded helmet, surmounted with a pair  of hawks wings, and a sword girt to his side.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Before long he struck the open glade they had gone down by  moonlight, and following it to the end, he found, after a little  search, the opening of another path.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Before his father had time to reply, Helgi sprang from his seat  with a shout, and saluting Osla on the cheek, exclaimed,    First of all King Esteins friends I wish you joy!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"}],"a":[{"sentence":"A little later he said,    So the feud is at an end, and I have found a queen.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"a

and  turned when he came upon them.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A fairer face and brighter eyes I never saw before.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A number of men  stood about among the houses, and from their movements and the  presence of two or three sledges he judged that a party must  either have lately arrived, or be on the point of departing.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A  friend of his sons would ever be welcome.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A little, however, I may venture to raise it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A ladder  reached from the floor to the loft, and at one end, that nearest  the outer door, a fire of logs burned

Norsemen.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A dozen voices instantly claimed the service.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A ghostly flicker of  light struggled through the narrow windows, and on the fires the  embers slowly died.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A fair fight, he thought, is always manlier than a secret  slaying, but not Odin himself would fly away with the foe who had  slain two shiploads of his followers, and afterwards challenge him  to single combat.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A grim smile stole over Esteins face, and presently he stopped  beside Grim, and said,    Know you where Liot sleeps in this hall of his?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A herd of deer browsed unheeded on a distant slope, the hours  passed, and the sun sank low in the west, while he sat there  alone.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A wolf, then, I am, he replied; and I can but try to keep my  lips drawn over my fangs and bit on my hind legs, and practise  manliness as best I may.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A kettle sang a drowsy song  and seemed to lay a languid spell upon him, and, as in a dream, he  heard the hermit offer up an evening prayer.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A thin thread of smoke rose straight heavenward in the  still air, and before the entrance of the cell whence it issued  stood an old and venerable man.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"A third time he  charged, and selecting a place where the defenders seemed  thinnest, struck

decks were densely  crowded with men who had retreated from vessel to vessel before the  onslaught of the vikings.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"At the same time Kolbiorn Stallare went up to Olafs side, and the two,  so much alike in size and dress, stood shoulder to shoulder, with their  shields before them and their swords in their

about her neck in a waving tangle, and he saw that  she was tall and slender.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"At that instant the  figure turned a shrouded face on him, and said sternly, and so  clearly that the words were ringing in his ears when he woke,    What doest THOU here, Estein Hakonson?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"At last he rose and retraced his steps back to the shore.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"At last Estein saw he was observed, and passing his hand across  his brow as if to sweep away his thoughts, asked wearily,    Where do we go now, Helgi?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"At these  words he turned and cried fiercely,    Who talks of doing little?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"At length he raised his head and asked,    Are we alone, Osla?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"At feasts his spirits sometimes rose to an extraordinary pitch.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"At the mans cry they all looked round, and he saw the girls  face.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"At last we reached a solitary woodmans house, and there for a  brief space we paused to inquire of the good man whether he had  seen us pass that way.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"At this last speech Estein first frowned and flushed, and then  meeting his fosterbrothers

thoughtfully.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was about midday, when, as they were coming down a wooded  slope, Helgi exclaimed,    Hark!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is highly befitting, she said, more soberly and a  little shyly.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  repeated twice, and then he heard Jomar rise with much growling,  and go softly across the floor.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a wise inquiry, and the answer was  such as an entirely sober man might have reasonably expected.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It took them but a short  space to find the dead sentinel; and thereupon Thorar, who seemed  almost beside himself with anger, sent the others off in haste to  intercept our road to Ketill, while he himself ran to collect a  force from the village.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It would seem so,  indeed, I replied, and thereupon ran him through with my blade  and opened the gate.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed strangely still and fresh in the open glade.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is she or her spirit, he exclaimed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It had been so dark and their flight so hurried that nothing  remained in his memory of the night before, to show him whither  the way was leading.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It  landed on its point and sunk almost out of sight in the snow.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was nearly noon when he awoke, and the sun was streaming  through the attic window.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It all came true then?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was another Estein whom you saw before.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  too late to turn back, even had his pride allowed him to think of  taking such a course.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was done  with neither my knowledge nor consent, and none grieved at such an  outrage more than I.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed to him to have  an almost supernatural import, and again he said to himself, An  old man, a maiden, and a spell.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It fell wet and  gusty at night, and Osla, bending over the couch, could hear  nothing but the wind and the roost she knew so well.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is more fitting, replied Helgi, for the man who comes back  to be cheerful.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"it was a song I sung myself.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was easy to see that.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was about two hours after midnight when the long ship, stealing  under the shadow of the cliffs, turned into a small bay.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It will take us full two hours to reach the bay where Liot  dwells, and the feast, I fear, will have ended even now, for the  hour is late.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a stern and sombre coast, unbroken by any bays or inland  glimpses, and gloomy and terrible in the fading light.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It has come true sooner than I  expected.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is  unlucky to break such spells so rudely.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was dark, but he  seemed to see plainly a figure, wrapped in a long cloak, walking  before him towards the cells.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is hard to part, but it must  come some day, and these verses are my parting song.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It  seemed to him a face that appeared and then vanished, and a faroff  voice that whispered a warning in his ear.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the work of  Ulf, captain of the forecastle; and roaring like a bull, the old  Viking followed his stone.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is ill that a man should die thirsty.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is the king!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was amidships that  the toughest fighting went on, and it was here that the larger number  of the defenders met their death.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is ill made and cumbrous, and a  figure of the cross will take less room in our stem and bring us more  luck withal.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  not very long ere yet two others followed; and then the Short Serpent  was exposed, even as her four companions had been.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is for Christs faith that we fight today.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  only that, taken wholly unawares, he had need to prepare for the coming  battle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is the host of King Sweyn of Denmark, for I  saw the banner on one of the longships, and it was like unto the  banners that Sweyn Fork Beard carried at the time when we were with him  in England.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the ship of Eindrid of Gimsar.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was very large, and the hull timbers  at both bow and stern were plated with thick staves of iron from the  gunwales down to the waterline.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was yet early morning when King Olaf again went on deck.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is not for Christian folk to inquire into  the future.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was, therefore, a very  natural thing that the earl should go thither also.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed that if only for the sake of  domestic peace an expedition to Wendland must soon be brought about.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It  was that, by reason of her flight from Wendland, she had forfeited all  the possessions that had been reserved as her dowry.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  very splendidly furnished, with beautifully carved wood and tapestries  of woven silk.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is not  probable that she was very deep in the water; but of this there is no  record.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was I  who did it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It  was they who, two years afterwards, united their forces in the great  sea fight in which Olaf the Glorious lost his life.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is told that  great Odin once swore on the ring.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  most beautifully wrought and interwoven with scrolls and circles so  delicate that all wondered how the hand of man could achieve such  perfection.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the face of Gudrun.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is our god Thor, answered one of the chieftains.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a very large and splendid building.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is held as a sacred custom among us that we shall make  sacrifices to our gods, and we now hold that, although you are our  king, you have no power to decide which gods we are to believe in, or  in what manner we shall worship.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is told that the storm abated  near to the ships while it still roared wildly some distance away from  them.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is because  our god, who rules all, has come, and looks on you with keen eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed to  her that he had suddenly become a decrepit old man.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is that you shall follow in pursuit of Earl Hakon and bring him to  his bane.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was you who,  escaping from Sweden with your mother, were captured by Esthonian  vikings and sold into slavery.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was in the early springtime when he reached Dublin,  and he was not long in learning that Ole was then living at the court  of King Kuaran, his brotherinlaw.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was an expedition  greater than any that Brihtnoth had ever met with steel or Ethelred  with gold, and its purpose was one of deliberately planned invasion and  conquest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a principle of the Christian faith; said  Cerdic, that men should remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy, that  they should not bow down to graven images, that they should not steal,  nor be covetous, nor do murder, nor bear false witness; that they  should love their enemies and bless those who cursed them.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the face of his own fellowslave in far  off Esthonia, his companion in Holmgard, his shipmate Egbert, whom he  had believed to be drowned.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is but a  matter of endurance, and one good sword, well wielded, is as good as  the strongest gate ever made.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was considered very  important in the early part of a battle that the shield fortress should  not be broken or opened, nor could such a breach be easily effected  except by overpowering strength or stratagem.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It  is told that during this march he came to a certain monastery and asked  for food for his army.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seems to me, said Kolbiorn, when Olaf had told him of the defeat  of the Jomsvikings, that now with these forty ships that are ours we  might very well fare to Norway, and take vengeance upon Earl Hakon.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed now that the few  Jomsvikings who were left would have the glory of victory all to  themselves.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is  said that some saw the maidens of Odin, the Valkyrias, standing at the  prow of Hakons ship, sending forth a deadly hail of unerring arrows.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It hit him in the  middle and killed him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the custom at such feasts as this that the high seat, or throne,  of the man whom the guests were met to do honour to, should be left  vacant until the memorial toast of the deceased, and of the mightiest  of their departed kinsmen, had been proposed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was in the autumntide that Olaf encountered the first serious storm.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It may be that he also was  cruel, for it is told that he was stern and wrathful with all who  offended him, and that in punishing his enemies he knew no mercy.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  evident to him that she was a trading ship, which the vikings had but  newly attacked and plundered.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the summer season, when all the channels of the sea were clear  of ice, and there were many trading ships abroad which might have been  an easy prey had Olaf so chosen to fall upon them.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is that we shall climb over the bulwarks, said he, and walk  outboard along the oars while the men are rowing.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a proud moment for Olaf when, just at the suns setting and at  his own word of command, the oars of the six ships were thrust out from  the bulwarks and the vessels began to move slowly out of the bay.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is still very young, said he with a smile.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is full five days since I parted company with my  fellows.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It might be that Sigurd Erikson, who was as he knew  very wealthy, would help him to meet the weregild.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was that  Queen Gunnhild had already been seeking to fulfil her vow, and had been  attempting through her wicked sorcery to bring about young Triggvis  death.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is even so, replied Sigurd.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was through his foolish love of this wild hearted son that Harald  Fairhair was led to commit an act whereby he undid all the great work  of his life.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is but  right that I should know.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is a  great pity, said she, that one so fair should be doomed to die before  he has grown to manhood.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed, indeed, that he had become suddenly hard of  heart and dauntless, as though he thought that the killing of a man was  a matter to be proud of.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a  causeless murder, and we claim the full and lawful punishment.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It  was ever so with your forefathers; thoughtless, fearless, ruthless!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is not well that a youth so clever  as he should waste his years in an inland town.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is the same!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was my father whom Klerkon slew that day upon the ship, and  it is my part to avenge him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is that our old enemy Klerkon  the Viking has come into Holmgard, with many men and a mighty horse  that is to be pitted against Sleipner.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is for your own happiness that I forbid you to show yourself before  strangers, returned Sigurd.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"It is too late for you to try to keep me within doors, he protested.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"It seemed  that she was bent upon knowing his history, for she besought many  persons about the court to tell her whence he had come, and to discover  for her the names of his parents.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"It is an island, out across the Western Sea, explained Thorgils;  often have I heard it named.","nextSentStartsWith":"as"},{"sentence":"It is but three days since that  he bought me, and I can ill understand the tongue these men speak, for  I am not of this land.","nextSentStartsWith":"estein"},{"sentence":"It is more easily broken than my promise.","nextSentStartsWith":"her"},{"sentence":"It is a bargain!","nextSentStartsWith":"rand"},{"sentence":"It may be that he is a little wild and wilful, but you can tame  him, and a sound flogging will do him no harm, as I have ofttimes  found.","nextSentStartsWith":"her"},{"sentence":"It stood stubbornly glaring at him with its small  bloodshot eyes, then suddenly charged at him with a savage roar.","nextSentStartsWith":"so"},{"sentence":"It chanced then that he was again beside the sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"thus"},{"sentence":"It was I who bought him from the vikings, with  another of his kindone Thorgils, who is to this day my bond slave.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"It seemed that the lad was of good station, for his clothing was of  finely woven cloth, and there was a gold neckband to his kirtle, and  his long black hair was well combed and curled.","nextSentStartsWith":"his"},{"sentence":"It may be, my boy, said he, that you will yourself command great  ships of war in time to come.","nextSentStartsWith":"all"},{"sentence":"It is, said Olaf, that since I am now your lawful thrall, and must  go with you wheresoever you wish, you will go to Biorn the merchant and  buy from him my foster brother Thorgils.","nextSentStartsWith":"this"},{"sentence":"It is because he has given you that fine cloak that you think him  good, returned Thorgils tauntingly; but, believe me, he has his  private reasons for so bribing you.","nextSentStartsWith":"gradually"},{"sentence":"it is many summers  since I saw her last, nor had I heard any tidings of her for a long,  long while, until you told me that she had taken flight from Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"liot"},{"sentence":"It lay to the southeast of Esthonia, and it was a part of  what is now known as the Russian Empire.","nextSentStartsWith":"arne"},{"sentence":"It may be that he is some vikings son, I  cannot tell.","nextSentStartsWith":"thorar"},{"sentence":"It is the same who sold you into bondage.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  well trained, and many a well won fight had it fought.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was yet early in the forenoon when the games began.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was we who brought him into Esthonia.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was in the evening time.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It might be, indeed, that he had already gone across the river  to the security of Grim Ormsons hut; but it was greatly to be feared  that he had fallen into the hands of Klerkon Flatface.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is but justice that I have done.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It might be that with good training he would  become a very famous warrior, and I would gladly see him enlisted in  the service of the king.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It must surely be that you have powerful reasons for  keeping him from harm.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is a long story, lady, he said; and it may be that it is not new  to you.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is told that he was cunningly  poisoned by Queen Gunnhild.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is said that  Gunnhild had bewitched the arrow that slew him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is here!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the thought of  my mother that brought the tears to my eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed as if nothing would  now content him but that he should go out upon the wide ocean and spend  all his days in roving.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It befell at a time when Olaf had been in the queens service some four  summers that Sigurd Erikson went out into the far parts of the kings  dominions to levy the yearly taxes upon the people, and among those  that went with him on his journey were Thorgils Thoralfson and the  young Egbert of England.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It so chances that there are at this present time six of our  best warships, with their full number of seamen and warriors, now lying  in the haven behind Odinsholm.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seems not so difficult as I had hoped, he said, but let me see  you do it, and then I will follow.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was accounted a great  privilege by Olafs companions to be allowed to play upon this costly  board, and Olaf had made it a condition that all who used it must do so  without dispute.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is said that he could jump higher than his own height both backwards  and forwards, and this with his weapons and complete armour on.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is told that when Geira saw how kingly of aspect Olaf was, and how  handsome and courteous withal, she at once yearned for his love and  craved that he should wed with her and become a ruler in the land.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was his habit to lie  hidden behind some rocky promontory, or at the mouth of some vik, or  creek, and thence dart out upon his unsuspecting prey; and he would  thus creep along the coast from vik to vik, harrying and plundering  wheresoever he went.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was winter time, and the seas were rough, but the fleet  passed through the Danish islands without disaster, and came to an  anchorage in a large bay near which now stands the city of Copenhagen.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is the same name  that you bore at the time we first met in Wendland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is not well always to judge by appearances, Olaf said with a  smile.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It  might indeed be that Earl Sigvaldi, on proving himself the easy  conqueror, would attempt to place himself in possession of the realm,  and to assume the name and dignity of King of Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was customary in such battles for ship to fight against  ship and man against man; but in most cases Hakon, whose forces greatly  outnumbered those of his enemies, placed three of his longships against  one of the vikings.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seems to me, he cried, that it is not men whom we have to fight  today, but the worst fiends.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed that, like all the other vikings who had  spoken so boldly at that feast, Vagn was to be cheated of his vow, yet  he resolved to meet his death bravely.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is young Ole the Esthonian!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a title which the sea rovers of the north  often gave to the man whom they had chosen as their chief, and it  implied that he was a leader who ruled over warriors and who had  acquired a large number of warships.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was no great news to King  Ethelred, however.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was Olaf Triggvison who, if he failed  in his own attempt, at least pointed out the way by which King Sweyn of  Denmark and his greater son Canute at length gained possession of the  throne of England and infused the nation with the blood which now flows  in the veins of every true born Briton.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It will be  a tough encounter if we come hand to hand with that man.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is the metal that King Olaf has ever favoured, returned Guthmund;  and right glad will he be to hear that there is at least one man among  the English who is brave enough to be of that same opinion.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is because the king wishes you to cease your ravaging in East  Anglia and take away your ships and men, returned the spokesman.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It so happens  that this part of the country is already becoming somewhat bare of food  and we are wearying for new scenes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed for a long time that they could come to no agreement; but  finally the matter was so arranged that the gold was delivered into  Olafs hands and the messengers departed, with a mere half promise of  peace and the assurance that Olaf would remove his ships within twenty  days.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed that Cerdic was the hermits name.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was three years since he had first besieged  the East Anglian town, and in the interval the folk had returned to  their devastated dwellings and built them anew.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the custom of those days in England that if any two  men contended about a matter they should each bring twelve men and  dispute their rights in a pitched battle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It  chanced that rumours had reached him concerning a certain viking who  called himself Ole, and who was said to have won great renown in the  realm of King Ethelred.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is said by many men that he fell  into bondage; others say that he took refuge in Holmgard, where King  Valdemar reigns; and I have even heard it hinted that the viking naming  himself Ole the Esthonian, who has lately been warring in England, is  none other than Olaf Triggvison.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was you who, in your infancy, were  pursued through the land by Queen Gunnhilds spies.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was you who, in the sea fight against Earl Hakon,  rivalled in skill and prowess the most famous vikings of all  Scandinavia.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is you, and not Earl Hakon, who are the rightful king of all  Norway.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was he who had given her the gold ring that was now  upon her white finger, and he had promised her that he would make her  his queen.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was made of burnished bronze,  inlaid with gold and precious stones, and it bore the image of the  crucified Christ.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is told that in a quarrel with the islanders he slew three  men.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seems to me that your boasting, and that of the horned man,  whom you call your bishop, is far less than yesterday.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the largest and  most splendid ship that he had ever seen.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is my wish, said he, that we make peace and good fellowship  together, even as we have hitherto done.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is our intention, therefore, that  you shall make blood offering here as other kings have done before you.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  arranged that they should be wedded at the next yuletide.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed to him that there would now be a lasting peace in  the land, with good fellowship among all his subjects, and no more  bloodshed or quarrelling or discontent for ever after.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"it was shown to be made of copper and not of gold.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was noticed almost immediately that there was less bloodshed  among the people than formerly, and that the peasants lived in greater  security.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It has been told how he sent his priest Thrangbrand to Iceland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is because you are a Christian that I have come to you now, she  went on.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was not until the middle of the next springtime that the ship was  ready for sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the same  shield that he had bought from Thangbrand, bearing the image of the  crucifix.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was in the  case of Einar Eindridson, surnamed Thambarskelver.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It has already  been told how he fought in the sea fight against the vikings of  Jomsburg.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It happened that  Sigvaldis wife, the Princess Astrid, was then staying at the court of  her father King Burislaf, in Wendland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"it may be that we shall not then be both alive.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was not of myself that I was thinking, returned Sigvaldi.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was further agreed among the three chieftains, concerning the  expected battle, that he who first planted foot upon the Long Serpent  should have her for his own, with all the wealth that was found on  board of her; and each should take possession of the ships which he  himself captured and cleared of men.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seems to me, said Sweyn, on a certain morning when they were  talking this matter over, that the fairest way of all would be that we  should cast lots or throw the dice; and let it be that he who throws  the highest shall be first to attack King Olafs own ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was not very long before they saw a large and splendid dragon  sailing proudly into the channel.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is because a great host of war galleys are lying in the farther  bay, answered Thorkel.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It happened to the Swedes, as to the Danes, that  notwithstanding their superior numbers they found that they were ill  matched in skill and prowess with the Norsemen.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It struck the crest of  Eriks helmet, but did no harm.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It must be Gods  will that he now shall rule in Norway; and that is not strange, for I  see that he has changed the stem dweller on the Iron Ram.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is Olaf the King!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It contained much wonderful magic, and some  astonishingly hard strokes, as they told it; but reading between  their lines, the magic bears a strong resemblance to many spells  cast even at this day, and as for the sword strokes, there was  need for them to be hard in Norway then.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It may be but a waste of time, Estein replied.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is easily seen that our friend Liot is a valiant man, said  Helgi with a short laugh.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was now but a question of time.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is all that the sea has left me.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It would have  been an unchristian act to let you drown.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  long past midday by the sun, and he knew that he must have been  unconscious for some hours.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It has never been my custom to let a girl row me, he replied,  taking the oars.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is not that, she said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It concerns only you.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is fated I must go.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was neither Andreas nor his  daughter, and with some wonder he quickened his steps and overtook  it just as it was about to enter the hermits cell.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the second time he had heard the voice.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a deed, said the hermit, that made all Norway ring.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a dark  night, Vandrad, very dark, till we lit a fire that was seen by men  in the outer islands.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is I, indeed, Helgi, he said; and never have I felt more  glad to see a face and clasp a hand.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is no work for brave  men.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is ill sailing with a bewitched leader, he muttered.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It wants but a brisk fight now to cure  him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is as if he should catch a thief who had  stolen half his goods, and then throw dice with him for the rest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It lay  open to the south, guarded on either side by a precipitous  headland, and withdrawn from the tideway and the swell of the  western ocean.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the magic of love that  entangled me.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is no jest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was easily  seen that in quickness and dexterity with his weapon Liot was  inferior to his foe; but with wary eye and cool head he kept well  covered with his shield, shifting his ground all the time.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed as if they were right.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was the  finger of God alone, they said, that laid a blight on human minds,  and there before her was His handiwork.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a stave of oak, about two feet long, and shaped with some  care.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It will be a bloodless victory, Estein.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It would seem so indeed, replied the other, striking the door  again impatiently.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It seemed to him an  inspired insight into his past, and he started suddenly, and then  said slowly,    The shaft indeed flew true.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It took him but a moment to turn the alternatives over in his  mind, and then he suddenly hit upon a plan.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was Jomar himself who replied, though without turning over or  looking at the speaker.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It is she began, and then her gravity for an instant forsook  her again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It sounded likebut it was my dream;  and lying down again, he closed his eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was a raw, grey, blustering morning, with no smell of frost in  the air, but rather every sign of thaw, and the old man, after  watching the two tall mailclad figures stride off with their  dwarfish guide hastening in front, closed the door, and turned  with a grave and weary look back to the fire.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It can only be by  black magic that Atli made him serve us.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It will not take long now.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It behoved me then to be careful, and I set guards, and was not  too drunk myself that night.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  not till almost all had gone to rest that Estein returned, and  then he went straight to his bedchamber without exchanging more  than the barest greetings with those he found still talking low  over their ale around the fires.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"It was  not that his thoughts were running on this unusual summons; as he  passed through the dark vestibule he felt only a little curiosity,  and at the door he paused and looked out idly enough.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"}],"thrice":[{"sentence":"Thrice he threw up his  glittering knife high above his head and deftly caught it again.","nextSentStartsWith":"it"}],"well":[{"sentence":"Well told indeed, cried Helgi, laughing, an excellent  beginningno skald could do it better.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Well was it for you that the Orkney tides run strong.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Well has he foreseen that we should land upon  this spot, and he has so placed his host at the farther side of the  river that we shall not reach him without great difficulty.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Well satisfied was Sigvaldi at  hearing this offer made, and he gladly accepted it, for he had quickly  discerned that Ole the Esthonian was a young warrior whose help would  be most valuable, even apart from the great force of battleships and  fighting men that were under his command.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Well am I aware, oh, queen!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Well have you taught me the  use of my axe, Hersir Sigurd.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Well done, well done!","nextSentStartsWith":"but"},{"sentence":"Well is it for me that he  is not hurt by his fall into the sea, else would his fathers whip be  about my back.","nextSentStartsWith":"asked"},{"sentence":"Well met, Hersir Sigurd!","nextSentStartsWith":"you"},{"sentence":"Well do I know her, answered Sigurd.","nextSentStartsWith":"our"},{"sentence":"Well do I discern, said he, that you are of King Haralds race.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Well thought of, said Helgi; tis lucky we have one cool head  with us.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Well said, said Ketill.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Well I know your bravery, Ketill, began the king, and there is  no man    At that instant the ring of men round him suddenly opened and  Estein stood before his father.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"}],"they":[{"sentence":"They died away to a low whisper; but ere they were gone Estein had  caught the slight flavour of a foreign accent, and for an instant  he was on the Holy Isle again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They speak truth, answered Ketill.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were seven to one, at the least, but never  an inch of ground did we give, and never a stroke did we spare.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They died for their country as  I die, and his head fell back upon the snow.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They slew  them like cattle, Estein; and shall we spare the murderers now?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They had now broken into a run, and the uproar sounded so loud  that they knew they must be close upon the town.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They talked so low that Helgi  could catch nothing they said, and even the quality of the girls  voice only reached him in snatches.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They went up to the loft by the ladder, heard Atli open a  door and evidently enter some inner room, then being very drowsy  after the cold air, shortly fell asleep.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They come in my story.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They looked each other in the face for an instant, and then  simultaneously broke out into another fit of mirth.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They came out of a house,  and one, the taller of the two, went up to a group of men standing  near, while the other, who looked like a peasants wife, hung  behind.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They found that it consisted of a few mean  houses clustered outside a high wooden stockade.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They are my only children, and them I shall  willingly give you as hostages till your return, that I may save  my country from fire and sword.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They saw that the stranger was a tall,  elderly man with a clever face and a dignified bearing.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They sailed far up the coast, and then, leaving their ship in a  northern fiord, struck inland across the mountains.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They whom the gods have cursed, replied Estein, have little  cause for laughter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were  oftener together than ever, and his fosterbrother had far more  influence with him than any other man.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They fly!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They will find their ships ready for sea, he said.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"they will be struck as we take them on  board, exclaimed Helgi.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They take to the water!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They hurried through the door, and bearing their captive on their  shoulders, the whole party broke into a run.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They will keep no watch.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They call it Haey, the high island, and it is on a bay to the  south of it that Liot Skulison dwells, answered Grim, their pilot  for the time.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They  wait for me now, and I must leave you.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They have come for me, Osla, and I must go.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They say, Estein, that your hermit has a fair daughter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were being carried by the current towards the place where he  stood, and presently they made a landing on the rocks.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They died heathens, and their souls are as  hopelessly lost as the soul of Olaf Hakonson.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They shrieked, Vandrad; they cried till the roof  fell in, and then they died.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They scrambled together up the rocks, and then struck a winding  sheeppath that led them over the shoulder of a heathclad hill.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They  and the hands belonged to a fair young girl, a maid of some  seventeen summers, on whose knees his aching head had just been  resting.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They came back too late.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They will meet with other than bairns today, said Helgi.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were observed, and the strange Vikings awoke and gave  chase like a swarm of bees incautiously aroused.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They are doubtless making  ready to board us.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They have taken the shields from the sides, Estein exclaimed as  the ship drew nearer.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They  must have broached the ale overnight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They saw much to stir them that morning.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They surrounded the Serpent like a pack of eager wolves held at  bay; and the most eager of all men there present was Earl Erik.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They are bearing westward for Svold!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They looked  eastward along the line of the Wendic coast, and as they watched they  saw a great number of ships upon the sea, bearing outward from Stetten  haven.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They all stood back aghast.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They welcomed him with very great love.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They had climbed the higher ground, so that they might  better calculate upon the chances of the coming battle, and great was  their surprise to see how skilfully Brihtnoth had arrayed his men.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They walked  some distance apart from the host of shipmen, and took their stand on a  grassy knoll overlooking the opposing armies.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They sailed up the  Orwell river, and fell upon the town first with arrow and spear and  then with sword and axe.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They began to shiver, though  for the most part they fought bravely enough.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They jumped on board of her, and had her rowed some distance  away, so that they might rest themselves and make ready for a new  attack.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They  were formed into three divisions, and Earl Sigvaldi laid his flagship  in the centre of the line of battle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were in want of food at  this time, and Vagn Akison and Olaf Triggvison went on their skiff to  the island of Hoed, not knowing that the earl lay in the bay near the  island.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They made great coast raids, and often  burned towns and hamlets.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They had murdered King Triggvi and his four brothers, and they had  little scruple in employing the same means towards Earl Sigurd, so they  entrapped him and put him to death.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They  contended as to who could climb the steepest rock, and at last they  made a bet.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They declared  that Olaf was but increasing his influence and power so that in the end  he might do some hurt to the king and to the realm.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They admired his easy seat  upon horseback, and, when he spoke, they marvelled at the full richness  of his voice.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They  decided that as the young murderers death would in no way profit them  they would accept the fine.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They had  many battles with Triggvi, but they could not conquer him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They claimed him as their king, calling him Hakon  the Good, and he reigned in Norway for many years, nor did he seek to  do any ill to his nephew, Triggvi Olafson, but confirmed him as king in  Viken.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They found the king in  London town, and, being fully armed, they entered his feasting hall  where he sat.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were jealous of each other and for ever quarrelling among  themselves.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They assembled a great fleet of warships and met the conqueror in the  Hafrsfjord.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They  were the voices of the vikings calling aloud for the blood of him who  had slain their chief.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were held  on the great plain beyond the gate, where fences were raised as a  girdle round the course.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They speak of making a sally  across the sea to Angle land, where there is corn and ale in plenty,  with fine clothes, good arms, and vessels of silver and gold to be won;  for these Christian folk are very rich, and there is abundance of  treasure in their churches, with many a golden bowl and well wrought  drinking horn as booty for those who are bold enough to make the  adventure.","nextSentStartsWith":"before"},{"sentence":"they shouted.","nextSentStartsWith":"olaf"},{"sentence":"They are ill matched against the vikings, with all their ships,  returned Klerkon.","nextSentStartsWith":"greatly"},{"sentence":"They had gone a little distance seaward down the dale when they were  met by three armed horsemen, who seemed to have been waiting for them.","nextSentStartsWith":"they"},{"sentence":"They watched him silently until he was asleep,  then as they lay there with the stars shining down upon them through  the dark tree branches, they questioned one the other concerning what  had happened to them that day.","nextSentStartsWith":"long"},{"sentence":"They were  years of preparation for his great work in the after time; and although  he learnt very much and acquired a large part of the skill that was to  make him famous among men, yet his days were without adventure.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They had seen many bondswomen who were fair, they said,  and how could they tell that any one of them was she whom the young  hersir was now seeking?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They are all made captivethe Hersir Sigurd, Thorgils  Thoralfson, and the rest of themand I alone have escaped.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They slandered him  and spoke all manner of evil against him, representing him as a  dangerous rival to Valdemar in the affections of both the queen and the  people.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were  bound by very strict laws to obey their chief.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They fitted out  their best warships and loaded them with weapons, and their warriors  were mustered to the number of eight thousand well trained men, with  eighty chosen battleships.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were lying in Ulfasound, off Stad, when  they and Hakon Jarl heard of each other.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were made to sit in a  row on the trunk of a fallen tree.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They presently determined that it could be no other country than  England.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"they cried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They found  the doors securely locked, the watchdog was asleep in the yard, and the  snow bore no trace of footprints.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They knew  that the king would have them abandon their old customs and accept the  new faith.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They  agreed to be christened there and then, and Bishop Sigurd at once  baptized them, and all the bonders who were present.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They came nearer  and nearer, and at last they halted at the gates.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They sat together and talked over the matter of their wedding, and of  how they would unite their domains and rule together over all the  Swedes and Norsemen.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were  as white as newly fallen snow, with a large blood red cross in the  middle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They all  thought it a most wonderful sight, and they cheered lustily as, in  answer to a loud blast from the kings bugle horn, the rowers began to  pull.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They  had appointed to waylay King Olaf Triggvison in a certain channel  running between the mainland and the island of Svold, and Sweyn had now  sent this messenger bidding the earl to so bring it about that they  might fall upon King Olaf in that place.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They drifted on until they came to a  curve in the channel which opened out into the bay where the host of  King Sweyn and his allies waited in ambush.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They had watched every movement of the tall and  splendid form of the Norse king as he fought in his shining armour and  his bright red tunic on the Serpents lypting.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They did so, and  the ship turned about.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They went straight overboard,  and several sank down with their weapons between the ships.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They have ale enough on board to float the ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They watched the strange fleet in silence as one by one they  turned and bore down upon them, ten ships in all, their oars  rhythmically churning the sea, the strange monsters on the prows  creeping gradually nearer.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They came out to fight, and better sport could  generally be had from a crew of seasoned warriors like themselves  than from the softer peoples of the south.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They answered with a loud shout, and then struck up a wild  and monotonous chorus, the words of which were a refrain  descriptive of the usual fate of those who ventured to stand in  Liot Skulisons way.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They call them the bairnslayers, because  they show no mercy even to children.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They are giving way on Thorkels ship.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They had drifted into one of the dreaded  Orkney tideways, and all the time the fight was raging they were  being borne at increasing speed past islands, holms, and skerries.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were sitting on a shelving rock that jutted into the tideway,  and at his feet his kindly plank bumped gently in an eddy of the  current.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They are gone, he said, turning away, friends and foesgone,  or drowned, as I should have been, fair maid, but for you.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They are the most pitiless of  all the robbers in these seas.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They descended the hill, and in a little creek on the shore came  upon a skiff.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They who visit the Holy Isle must rest content with hard  pillows, said Andreas.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were feasting, and they heard not our  approach.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They asked us to let the women out, but we had come there to slay  and not to spare.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They pushed off in silence, the oars dipped in the quiet sound,  and Estein left the Holy Isle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They drew closer and closer to the land, until a towering line of  cliffs rose for more than a thousand feet right above their heads.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They told each other that this was no earthly  mist that had fallen on them, and listening to the break of the  sea on the cliffs, they talked low of wizards and seamonsters,  and heard strange voices in the sound of the surge.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They crossed a strip of rising heather and struck a sharp slope of  turf.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They could see behind them the flames and smoke rising ever higher  from the burning vessels, and as the ale mounted to their heads  they shouted derisive defiance across the water.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They found a wide ring marked off with stones, and in this the two  champions took their stand.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They  fly!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They stood on a desolate hillside a little above the highest pine  woods, examining the tracks of a bear, when Helgi suddenly turned  to him and said,    Do you not think, Estein, you have moped and mourned long  enough?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They shall see that my arm is longer than they deem, replied the  king grimly.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They are fit  neither to be friends nor enemies.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were gradually approaching a dark forest, which stretched  from the edge of the lake inland, and latish in the afternoon they  entered it by a narrow, rutty road.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They dropped on the other side, and whispering to Estein to  follow, the man turned to the wood and was about to plunge in,  when his companion seized his arm, and said,    I trysted here with my foster brother.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They have run, they are still running, and while I live I see not  what is to stop their course.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They were silent for a time, and then Estein exclaimed,    We are well quit of that country of Jemtland!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They reached Hernersfiord towards nightfall, and as they crept up  the still, narrow waters darkness gathered fast.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"They walked slowly up to Hakonstad, the old earl leaning upon his  sons arm, and as they went Helgi told him the tale of the  Jemtland journey.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"}],"and":[{"sentence":"And that she cried in astonishment.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now you seek me?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And he left me a  writingfor he had taught me the art of reading on the islandand  with it much silver, or at least it seemed much to me.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And tell her, added Helgi as the birdman turned away, that  here sits the kings fosterbrother, a most proper person at all  times to hear a maidens tale, and now most persuasively charged  with ale.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now for a horn of ale, and then to bed, responded Helgi,  cheerful as ever again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"and  then again, Trolls take me, if this be not enough to make a bear  laugh!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And yet you sail to Orkney?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And whither were you sailing?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And  with that I bound him firmly to a tree, and left him to think upon  his misdeeds.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And with that he took his shield from  his back.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now to sleep.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And certainly there was noise enough to be  heard.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And what compensation does the king intend to make?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And when the fit  passed away he was quieter than ever.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And so the days went by; summer changed to autumn, and autumn gave  place to winter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And Vandrad, the searover, had gone with the sunshinehad gone,  never so Osla said to herself, to return again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And the spell is broken?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And the hermit?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And his hands were tied by a stronger  chain.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And so the time passed away, till Estein had spent six weeks in  the Holy Isle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I have to thank your daughter that I am not there now,  Estein added.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I, that I am with an overconfident crew, she answered.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And you have five brothers to avenge; the sword should not rust  long in your scabbard, Estein.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And what is my fate, old man?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And yet, Estein, he added in a lower tone, as he embraced him,  I would that Yule were here again and you with it.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And then again, as the stir increased, and he could see the men  beginning to troop on board the long ships,    This voyage shall be as the falling of snowflakes into the sea;  but what man can escape his fate?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And when the word went round that the rescued man was  Kolbiorn Stallare and not the king, the lad pointed outward upon the  sea and all looked in amaze upon the shining crucifix as it rose and  fell with the motion of the waves.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And then there came the sound of hurried feet upon the stairs, and  Einar Eindridson rushed upon the upper deck, followed by three of his  shipmates, and pursued by Earl Erik and a great crowd of clamouring  vikings.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And as  the weight increased so did the Serpent lean over, until at last her  bulwarks were almost on a level with those of the Iron Ram.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now the  Long Serpent lay with only two companions, the Short Serpent at her  starboard and the Crane at her larboard side.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I have been thinking,  ever since this battle began that the great luck of Olaf may be due to  that sign of the cross that we see on all his banners and shields.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And it may be that in this he was right.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now the battle raged fiercely.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And his heathen Sweden, I think,  would find it more agreeable to sit at the fireside and lick their  sacrificial bowls than to board the Long Serpent under the rain of our  weapons.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now, taking the lead, he arrayed his ships in order, with the Short  Serpent and the Crane together in his immediate wake, and his eight  other longships following close behind.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And  what is the meaning of your coming back?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now did Sweyn at once understand how greatly he had  been mistaken in what he had expected of King Olafs famous dragonship,  and how much his fancy had fallen short of the reality.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And then he went to the ship and planed out all the notches and cuts,  and made the bulwarks so smooth and fair that all who saw what he did  declared that the ship was made far handsomer than she had been before.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And when she had told him all her  trouble he gave her good counsel and a kindly welcome, and said that  she should always have a peaceful dwelling in his realm.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And the  husband whom Sigvaldi and Sweyn chose for me was their fatherinlaw,  King Burislaf.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And Kolbiorn left Olafs side and went to  meet her.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And although you had twice the wealth that you have and were  yet more glorious than you are, yet never should I obey such a bidding.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And she rose and took up the ring he had sent as a gift, which  ere this time her two smiths had repaired.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And at last he took her hand and swore by the holy  rood that he would be true to her.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And she let them break the ring  asunderand lo!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And  as a token of his good faith the king had sent her a gift.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And it seemed that her messages had the effect that she  wished.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now she deemed that she had at last discovered one  whose magnificence would match with her own.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And then they thought of  Ironbeards daughter, Gudrun, and of what a good thing it would be for  them if the king could be made to wed her.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And yet, said Olaf; it seems to me that he is made of nothing more  strong than wood.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And aloud he said: The god with whom you have threatened us is blind  and deaf and can help neither himself nor others; nor can he move  anywhere from his place unless he be carried.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And who is the young King Olaf that he has power to fill the heart of  the great Earl Hakon with terror?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And what thing is that?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And the cry was echoed upon every  side.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And two of their  chieftains went forward to meet him, uncovering their heads.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And yet as his  vessel sailed on, plunging through the dashing foam, with her prow  rising and falling within the wide span of that great rosy arch,  strange doubts came over him, the old beliefs still lingered in his  mind, and he began to think that perhaps his new learning was false,  that Thor might after all be supreme in the world, and that this red  light in the sky was an evidence of his continued power, a visible  defiance of Christ.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now he had his men pull down this temple to the ground, so  that not a stone of it remained standing in its place.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And Olaf, listening, received it all as the very  truth, nor doubted for an instant that the people were waiting ready to  welcome him back to the land of his fathers.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And it seemed that  Thorir had already guessed everything, for he said:    Glad news must it always be when a son hears that his mother, whom he  thought dead, is still alive.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And what manner of man is he?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And why should I take such a gift from a stranger, who owes me nothing  in the world?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I  charge you to thank King Ethelred for his generosity.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And as to his marching against you, of that matter he has said no  word.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And for what reason should King Ethelred send such a gift to me who  have done him no good service, but have only been despoiling his lands  and disturbing his peaceful subjects?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now the  fight began in desperate earnest.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And who is it that has told your chief that such is the habit of our  English kings?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And he brought his boat to the quarter and climbed on board.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And brandishing

sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now  Earl Hakon pulled up alongside the ship of Bui, and a combat ensued,  which has scarcely had its equal in all the battles of the Northmen.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And if you can truthfully tell us where he is, then your cows and goats  are safe.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And he drew down the gold ring from the thick part of his bare  left arm.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And in all his battles he never received a wound  or lost a ship, but always got the victory.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And Olaf  Triggvison took her bidding, and went with his chosen captains to the  court, where he was well received and most hospitably entertained.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And all who heard them regarded the  young chiefs words as words of wisdom, for they did not know, and  neither did Olaf himself at that moment dream, that Egbert and his  ships company were safe and sound in the shelter of the high headland  of Borgund holm.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And as to fighting, he added, I cannot think that any of you would  take pleasure in drawing arms against men who have not been trained in  warfare.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And to hasten Olafs departure he gave him great gifts of well wrought  weaponsa splendid sword inlaid with gold on the blade and set in the  hilt with dear bought gems, and a shield of embossed brass.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now he was dead and there was an end of all his  loving kindness.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And if  that be so, then we shall soon learn the truth.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And so much did he speak of the ships and of  the viking life that when at last the time came for the return to  Holmgard, Sigurd Erikson had hard work to win the boy away with him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And as his deft  fingers touched the trembling strings he chanted a little song, telling  of how the giant Loki, in punishment for all the ills he had done to  gods and men, was bound by strong cords against the walls of a cave,  with a serpent suspended over him dropping venom into his face drop by  drop; and of how Sigyn his wife took pity on him and stood by him for  hundreds of years, catching the drops as they fell in a cup which she  held.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And so when all who accused the boy had spoken, Sigurd,  the kings steward, was bidden to rise and say what he knew in Olafs  favour.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And so saying, she signed to them to leave the hall.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And if King Valdemar condemn  him to death for his crime, then do I crave that my life, and not the  boys, be taken.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now, she added, tell me how it came to pass that the boy was  ever brought across the sea to Esthonia.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And as what is left is the more important part, I beg  you to hear it to the end.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now, hersir, she added, we will hear the  rest of your saga.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now do I well believe that  it was he whom the kings mother meant when, at the yuletide feast, she  spoke of the child who was destined to be brought up here in Holmgard,  and who was to grow to be a famous prince.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And as he had many wives, so had he many  sons.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And yet, she added with quick pity, such a handsome boy  must not be slain.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now I mind that someone told me it  was he whom we captured among others many summers ago off Alland isle.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now, being first in the race, Olaf came once more before the tent,  and the queen gave him his well won prize.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And who will hinder him?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And the queen, startled and alarmed,  moved aside and presently walked majestically from the hall.","nextSentStartsWith":"cried"},{"sentence":"And yet Olaf seemed strangely unwilling to favour any plan of escape.","nextSentStartsWith":"ringan"},{"sentence":"And you shall live with me as my own dear foster son, he added, and  I will take care of you and teach you all that a kings son should  know, so that in the time to come you may be well fitted to claim your  dead fathers realm.","nextSentStartsWith":"in"},{"sentence":"And at last he laid the lad down on a bed of dry reeds and  moss at the side of the stream, where the bright moon, shining through  an open glade, shed its light upon his fair round face and his short  gold hair.","nextSentStartsWith":"a"},{"sentence":"And you will not try to escape?","nextSentStartsWith":"we"},{"sentence":"And he determined in his mind very  quickly, that when they were on the sea he would free himself from his  chain and jump overboard and swim to land.","nextSentStartsWith":"in"},{"sentence":"And at last Olaf came  out and ran swiftly backward and forward on the grassy level until he  was dry.","nextSentStartsWith":"king"},{"sentence":"And if he  runs so well there is all the more danger of his running away.","nextSentStartsWith":"now"},{"sentence":"And he is skilled in many feats.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"And now his wrath got the  better of him, and he leapt at the boar with a wild cry, seizing its  ears in his two hands.","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"And before Sigurd could put out his hand to detain him Olaf had bounded  up the rocks, and was soon lost to sight.","nextSentStartsWith":"vast"},{"sentence":"And  now, the boy added, as he glanced up at the darkening sky, it is time  that I go back to the hills to gather my masters sheep into the fold,  for the night will be dark, and wolves will be about.","nextSentStartsWith":"alfred"},{"sentence":"And what then?","nextSentStartsWith":"in"},{"sentence":"And what of that?","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"And then he looked yet  more keenly into the boys face, as if to seek some likeness there.","nextSentStartsWith":"they"},{"sentence":"And your name?","nextSentStartsWith":"earl"},{"sentence":"And he drew Sigurd with him across the  gangplank, and they went below and sat drinking until one of the  shipmen standing on the vessels lypting, or poop deck, sounded a  shrill horn as a sign that the ship was about to leave the harbour.","nextSentStartsWith":"choose,"},{"sentence":"And I am told that their king is a man of peace;  Edgar the Peaceable, they name him.","nextSentStartsWith":"there"},{"sentence":"And  they have many well built ships.","nextSentStartsWith":"olaf"},{"sentence":"And now, what news have you from west over sea?","nextSentStartsWith":"but"},{"sentence":"And how if the victory be mine and not yours?","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"And then the merchant spoke.","nextSentStartsWith":"to"},{"sentence":"And whose son is he?","nextSentStartsWith":"she"},{"sentence":"And at this the boy turned round and  said more softly:    Well, Thorgils, for your pleasure will I do it, and not for the  vikings praise.","nextSentStartsWith":"many"},{"sentence":"And the boys on the bank cried  out, Well done, Rekoni!","nextSentStartsWith":"i"},{"sentence":"And as he swam to shore the vikings  laughed aloud, and some who had thought of giving him a reward put back  their gold into their wallets and turned away.","nextSentStartsWith":"asked"},{"sentence":"And he thrust his thumbs into his belt and drew back.","nextSentStartsWith":"olaf"},{"sentence":"And all the while Sigurd Erikson kept his eyes upon the  lads glowing, upturned face.","nextSentStartsWith":"even"},{"sentence":"And whence came he into Esthonia?","nextSentStartsWith":"at"},{"sentence":"And what lordly business  brings you north to the coast?","nextSentStartsWith":"truly"},{"sentence":"And if my horse overcomes yours,  then the lad shall be my prize, and I will make a viking of him.","nextSentStartsWith":"but"},{"sentence":"And talking of kings, how fares  King Valdemar?","nextSentStartsWith":"now"},{"sentence":"And she  travelled as a fugitive through many lands.","nextSentStartsWith":"let"},{"sentence":"And at last  she took refuge on a certain islet in the middle of Rands fiord, and  lay hidden there for many days.","nextSentStartsWith":"olaf"},{"sentence":"And  after many hardships and dangers she came to Ofrestead, her fathers  dwelling, and there we abode through the winter.","nextSentStartsWith":"now"},{"sentence":"And the king sent to  Ofrestead.","nextSentStartsWith":"when"},{"sentence":"And well do I know it, returned Olaf.","nextSentStartsWith":"at"},{"sentence":"And why?","nextSentStartsWith":"presently"},{"sentence":"And when Olaf stood before him naked, Sigurd drew back amazed at  the pure fairness of his skin, the firmness of his well knitted  muscles, and the perfect beauty of his form.","nextSentStartsWith":"now,"},{"sentence":"And when we reach the town I will  buy you more fitting clothes, with sandals for your feet, and a cap to  shield your head from the sun.","nextSentStartsWith":"sigvaldi"},{"sentence":"And what country lies to the south?","nextSentStartsWith":"shouted"},{"sentence":"And if I  were a viking it is to England I would steer my course.","nextSentStartsWith":"if"},{"sentence":"And how came it, inquired Thorgils, that you were brought into  Esthonia?","nextSentStartsWith":"chapter"},{"sentence":"And what would it avail if we were to escape?","nextSentStartsWith":"how"},{"sentence":"And if either  should be slain, then the other will avenge his death.","nextSentStartsWith":"they"},{"sentence":"And now I believe that you have brought me here  only that you may secretly put me to death.","nextSentStartsWith":"drink"},{"sentence":"And yet, added the queen thoughtfully, I would say that this  boy Ole, as you call him, has no serfs blood in him.","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"And what of your father?","nextSentStartsWith":"he"},{"sentence":"And why did you agree to this, knowing that I am your own kinsman and  your sisters son?","nextSentStartsWith":"the"},{"sentence":"And by the hammer of Thor, I swear that if I  win him not over the horse fight, then I will take him by force!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And when the fight is overwhatever be the  resultmake your way over the river and keep well hidden in old Grim  Ormsons hut.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And if you cannot find him before the sunrise, then I will pay you his  just value in gold.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"and now  Klerkon would not rest until he had safely secured his coveted prize.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And  so all my teaching of you has gone for nothing!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And then  he was content.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And if I do not fulfil my vow, I shall die in the attempt.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And in Finland  he found a certain woman, the like of whom he had never seen for  fairness in all his roamings.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now I must tell the second reason  why Triggvi did not try to compass the death of King Erik.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I beg you, oh, queen!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now, said he, my story is at an end, and you know of what kin  this boy has come.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now, she added,  since I have at length learned of what great kin you are, it is my  wish that you shall be received here as becomes your royal birth, and  that you shall be educated as behoves a kings son.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"and we all  knew him to be the same viking who four summers ago was here in  Holmgard in the train of Jan Klerkon.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And much do I envy you your  adventure.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And yet, he added,  I cannot believe that you did this feat by your skill alone and  without some secret power.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And at length he made for Borgund holm, an island that  lies out in the Baltic to the south of Sweden.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And yet he was no boaster.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I propose that we shall find a new entertainment  which will long hereafter be remembered.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And  to set you an example, I will myself begin.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And so saying he quaffed his deep horn.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And there he fell to pillaging in the  dominion of Earl Hakon.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And what  token have you to show?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And you shall have a good  reward if you will come aboard our ship and show us the way into the  bay.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And ever when the decks were cleared there came on board other hosts of  men from the neighbouring ships.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And a third: I shall at least die in good company; but first,  let me tighten my belt.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And Earl Erik ordered his men to set  Olaf free from his tether.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And so it was done.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And he called to Olaf to come aboard.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now, with the  coming of Olaf Triggvison, a new danger was threatening.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And we have many good chances on our side.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And how if I refuse the gold and say that it does not suit my purpose  to remove my ships?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And yet, he added, remembering the terms of his mission, Earl  Hakon is not all that a peaceful people would wish.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And yet she was  very unlike what she had been in her earlier days, being pale now, and  lean, and ill clad.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And he has the whole of Norway at his back, while II have  but this one faithful servant.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now that Earl Hakon was dead the people did not shrink from  speaking their minds concerning him, and giving free vent to their  hatred of his low cunning and his faithlessness, his cruelty and his  profligacy.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now, while the king was living with his friends in quiet comfort  and homeliness, he laid his plans most earnestly before them, craving  that they should help him with all their might.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And  presently King Olaf saw a crowd of men approaching, carrying a large  image, ornamented all over with gold and silver.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And  I see that you are full of terror at sight of him!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I offer you two  choices.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And  it seemed that he would never bring his tale to an end.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And none of the bonders dared to  oppose him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And she snatched the pieces of  the ring and flung them furiously away from her.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And well do I mind  that, at that same feast in Denmark, you scorned me because I had been  a slave.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And we may take a cruise in the  Long Serpent across to the Orkneys, or north even to Iceland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And there is but one man I know of who has any  wish to wage battle with me.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And it seems that he is at  this very time abroad with his hosts in search of me.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And although Sweyn Fork Beard had thrice two score of warships, I  would rather fight him than turn tail like a coward hound.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And he cut his way through  the crowd of Danes, who, led by Sweyn himself, had been making a final  rally and preparing to board the Serpent.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now it must be told how Earl Erik Hakonson fared in that fight.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And now ensued  one of the sharpest combats that had been seen that day.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I can  read my fate yet further.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And the first part of Atlis prophecy has come true.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And with that the forecastle captain sprang down on the gangway,  and knocking men off into the waist in his impetuous rush, swung  his battleaxe round his head and aimed a terrific blow at Osmund  Hooknose.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I know further that every girl would not have been so  kind.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And  what do men call you?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And what of the gods I and my ancestors have worshipped for so  long?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And he rose and walked out into the night.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And where are Snaekol Gunnarson and Thorfin of Skapstead?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And at the thought he laughed aloud.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And here come those who will reach us before them, said another  man.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I still love his daughter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And you, Ketill, said Estein, turning to his former companion,  will you come with me?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And we shall, Osla!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And my father?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And as he  wandered on, his mind hardly grasped the bearing and significance  of forest clues.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And me to shiver at the gate, answered Helgi, with a laugh.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And what said Ketill?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And certainly for a man commonly  most careful of his appearance, he cut a comical enough figure,  with his shoeless feet and tangled hair, and the great illfitting  sheepskin coat huddled round him to hide the poverty beneath.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And I, replied Helgi, leave early in the morning, though now I  would fain stay longer.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And slender, added the irrepressible Helgi, though not loud  enough for Ketill to hear, and the stout Viking resumed his story,  sulkily enough.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"And well it was; for I had not slept an  hour, it seemed, before the cry arose that the enemy were upon us.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"}],"now,":[{"sentence":"Now, he added,  I am a Christian man, and my soul is safe with Christ.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, she said, when Estein had run the boat into the water, you  can rest while I row you across.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, he  would even have his name forgotten, and he is only known as  Andreas, which was the name of one of the blessed apostles; and  here we two live in a little lonely island, keeping aloof from all  men, and striving to live as did the early fathers.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, comrades, after him to Odin!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, as you are one of the wisest of men, Thorkel, give me the  best advice you know as to how that great ship may be won.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, Sweyn Forkbeard was a very cautious man in the affairs of war, and  he well knew that he was himself no match for so powerful a warrior as  Olaf the Glorious.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, although the peasants of Thrandheim yielded to King Olaf in the  matter of their faith and the forms of their religious ceremonies, yet  they were none the less enraged against him on account of the  destruction of their beautiful temple and the slaying of Iron Skeggi.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, when the time arrived for the midsummer sacrifice at Mere, Olaf  went thither with a great host of followers.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, this speech was plainly heard by both Earl Hakon himself and his  thrall as they crouched together in the cave, and by the light of the  candle that stood on the ground between them each eagerly watched the  others face.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, so soon as she saw him she knew that some great ill had happened,  for his hands trembled and his legs shook under him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, while Olaf Triggvison was still the guest of King Ethelred, there  also lived at the court a certain princess named Gyda.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, under Alfred or Athelstane such a reverse as the invaders had met  with before London would surely have been followed up by some crushing  victory.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, as the summer days passed by and it drew near to the harvest time,  Olaf bethought him of his tryst with King Sweyn Forkbeard, so he raised  his anchors and sped out into the open main and round by the forelands,  and so north to Ipswich.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, when that same wintertide had passed, and when the new buds were  showing on the trees, Olaf Triggvison arrayed his ships ready for the  sea.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, this same Thorkel was an old enemy of Vagn Akison, and  at the arvel of King Sweyn, Vagn had taken a solemn oath that he would  be the death of him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, it was a question with Earl Hakon what he should do with these  thirty captives.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, by this short absence, Earl Erik had weakened the southern wing,  and, when he came back to defend his ships, he found that Vagn Akison  and Olaf Triggvison had broken through the line and made great havoc.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, this was the selfsame oath that Olaf Triggvison had resolved to  swear when it should come to his turn, and he was annoyed that Earl  Sigvaldi had, as it were, snatched it from his lips.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now,  continued Sigurd, raising his voice so that all could hear, it is not  lawful for any Esthonian viking to attack a peaceful trading ship; but  Klerkon assuredly did this, and I therefore hold that it was he who was  the aggressor.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, while Hakon was away in England, his elder brother, Erik  Bloodaxe, went awarring in his viking ships to many landsScotland,  Wales, Ireland, and Normandy, and north away in Finland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, at high noon when the king and queen departed from the tent,  Sigurd made his way round to the entrance of the lists, and there  searched for Olaf and found him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, when Olaf was thus near, it seemed to Klerkon that the lad was not  wholly a stranger to him.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, carry me away.","nextSentStartsWith":"atli,"},{"sentence":"Now, Allogia was still but two and twenty years of age, and very fair,  and the king did not like that she should be seen holding speech with  his handsome steward, for fear that Sigurd should win her heart.","nextSentStartsWith":"a"},{"sentence":"Now, if Gunnhilds sons should learn that  you are living in Holmgard they would offer a rich reward to the man  who should compass your end.","nextSentStartsWith":"never"},{"sentence":"Now, Olaf had never taken any mans hand since he swore foster  brotherhood with Thorgils Thoralf son.","nextSentStartsWith":"my"},{"sentence":"Now,  scarcely was our vessel beyond the sight of land when we were met by a  great viking ship, that bore down quickly upon us, and attacked our  seamen, first with arrows and stones, and then with spear and sword,  and there was great fighting.","nextSentStartsWith":"olaf"},{"sentence":"Now, after the slaying of Triggvi, Queen Astrid  was forced to fly from the realm of Viken, lest she too should fall  into the hands of Gunnhild and her wicked sons and be slain.","nextSentStartsWith":"then"},{"sentence":"Now, very close to where Sigurd Erikson was there stood two boys, whose  close cropped hair and dress of coarse white vadmal showed them to be  slaves.","nextSentStartsWith":"but"},{"sentence":"Now, Olaf had engaged to take part in a great wrestling bout with three  young champions from Livonia.","nextSentStartsWith":"you"},{"sentence":"Now, very soon after Sigurd had gone out to attend upon the king, Olaf  quitted the house and went by secret ways to the stables, where he  found his foster brother at work combing out the mane of Sigurds  fighting steed.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, by this time, the enraged vikings and many men of the town had  gained entrance to the outer court, and they rushed forward to claim  the life of the offender according to their custom and laws.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, at the time I speak of I was already in the service of King  Valdemar; so Astrid thought that the best means of escaping her enemies  and of saving her son was that she should come here with Olaf into  Holmgard.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, loosen the boys chains!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, when Olaf heard these things and understood that Earl Hakon,  although not of royal birth or lineage, was still recognized as the  king in Norway, he resolved to join issue with the Danes and Wends in  their projected expedition, and he spoke with Earl Sigvaldi, offering  the support of all his ships and men.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, during the summer months of that same year, Olaf went out upon a  viking cruise into the Gulf of Bothnia.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, the  spear was one which Olaf himself had before thrown into the midst of  the English ranks, and it had now been returned in such a manner that  Olaf at once knew it had been hurled by some man trained as the vikings  were in the use of the weapon.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, when Olaf Triggvison heard these things, there came upon him a  certain impatient desire to fare across to Norway and proclaim himself  a direct descendant of Harald the Fairhaired and the rightful heir to  the throne.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, in the marketplace of one of the  Esthonian seaports many thralls were brought for sale, and, among other  thralls who were to be sold, Lodin saw a certain woman.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, when this little battle was over, and Erlands ships had been  captured, Olaf Triggvison rowed yet farther into the fiord to  Trondelag, where all the chieftains and peasants were assembled.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, when evening was falling there came along the strath certain  horsemen, and the leader of them was King Olaf Triggvison.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, as the night wore late, and the festivities flagged, the guests  rose from the board, and either departed to their several rooms or drew  their cloaks about them and lay upon the side benches of the hall, and  at length King Olaf was left alone at the table.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, Burislaf was an elderly man, while I was but a  little girl, and I was sorely against this matter.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, already I had become a Christian, and it was little to my  satisfaction that I should become the wife of a pagan king and live for  ever after among heathen folk, so on a certain dark and stormy night I  fled away.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, Olaf Triggvison knew full well that in giving succour to Thyra he  was doing that which would give great offence to King Sweyn of Denmark;  and that Sweyn, when he heard that his sister was here in Norway, would  speedily come over and carry her back to Wendland.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, at this same time King Sweyn Forkbeard was in Denmark, living with  his new wife, Queen Sigrid the Haughty.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, Earl Erik was wise in warfare, and a man of keen judgment.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, Estein, I have thee!","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Now, as you see, you have the land at your  mercy; and as an ancient

costs.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"One thought alone disturbed his sense of security.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"One thing which more than all else won these people to him was  their knowledge that he was the same Ole the Esthonian who, with Vagn  Akison, had stood out to the end in the great sea fight against Hakon  of Lade.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"One of them said: I like very well to die,  but strike me quickly; I have my cloak clasp in my hand, and I will  thrust it into the earth if I wot of anything after my head is off.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"One gloomy forenoon his ships with their sails full set were speeding  before a strong wind through the wide channel of sea

pair of dark blue eyes.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Estein told her of the storm at sea and the fight with the  Vikings; how they had fallen man by man, and how he too would have  been numbered amongst the dead but for the tideway and the rocks.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Estein would  fain have lived in her society all day, listening to her talk and  watching the wind play with her hair, and every day he noticed,  with a sense of growing disappointment, that he saw her more  seldom.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Estein sat down and took his supper; and all the time  he was eating, Andreas paced the floor saying nothing aloud, but  muttering continually under his breath.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"},{"sentence":"Estein bent forward,

for a  minute as if to make sure who he was, and then he snapped back  shortly,    He said he had lost a dog that answered to the name of Helgi, and  would be well pleased if the beast had died of the

again.","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"}],"naught?":[{"sentence":"Naught?","nextSentStartsWith":"behold"}],"perhaps,":[{"sentence":"Perhaps, he thought, Helgi  might be wandering the country too, and if
